"Intel (INTC) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-intc-trending-stock-130017532.html?.tsrc=rss,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024 13:00:17 +0000",Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned +12.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 15.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Intel is expected to post a loss of $0.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -107.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.27 points to a change of -74.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.08 indicates a change of +302.7% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Intel. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $13.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.1%. The $52.18 billion and $55.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.8% and +6.2%, respectively. Intel reported revenues of $12.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $0.02 for the same period compares with $0.13 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.7%. The EPS surprise was -80%. Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

 Key Points Which of these chipmakers is the better investment right now? Intel (INTC -2.84%) and Micron Technology (MU -3.41%) both provide essential chips for modern computers and data centers. Intel is the world's top producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, and Micron is a leading supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips. Both chipmakers manufacture most of their own chips at their internal foundries. But over the past five years, Intel's stock plunged 55% as Micron's stock soared 137%. Let's see why Micron outperformed Intel by such a wide margin -- and if it's still a better overall investment in the growing semiconductor sector. Image source: Getty Images. Three big blunders caused Intel's recent crisis: As Intel struggled with product delays and chip shortages, many PC makers pivoted toward Advanced Micro Devices, which outsourced its production to TSMC's superior chip foundries. Instead of laying out a clear turnaround strategy, Intel went through jarring strategic shifts under three different CEOs over the past six years. Intel's current CEO Pat Gelsinger initially believed the chipmaker could expand its foundries to catch up to TSMC by 2025, but the dismal yields for its newest 18A chips indicate it will broadly miss that target. Earlier this year, Intel laid off 15% of its workforce and suspended its dividend. It's also reportedly considering a spin-off or sale of its foundry unit, which would raise a lot of cash but completely reverse Gelsinger's original plans. For now, Intel is struggling to hold off AMD in the x86 CPU market as it ramps up its production of its lower-margin ""AI CPUs"" (which add more AI processing features to its chips) to remain relevant in the AI race. However, those chips still can't process AI tasks as rapidly as Nvidia's stand-alone GPUs. Micron isn't the world's biggest producer of DRAM and NAND chips but develops denser chips than its larger competitors. That technological edge makes it a preferred memory-chip supplier for high-end PCs, servers, and other devices. Micron's business is more cyclical than Intel's. The memory chip market generally goes through boom-and-bust cycles. The latest bust occurred in 2023 as PC shipments fizzled out, the 5G upgrade cycle for smartphones ended, and many data centers prioritized their purchases of AI-oriented GPUs over new memory chips. This year, however, a fresh growth cycle kicked off as the PC and smartphone markets stabilized. Data centers also bought more solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to support the demanding needs of new AI applications. Micron expects the AI market's secular expansion to fuel its long-term growth. Micron faces some competitive pressure from bigger chipmakers like Samsung and SK Hynix. China also banned Micron's chips from its infrastructure projects last year, and it could face more headwinds if the tech war between the U.S. and China intensifies. But Micron doesn't face any existential challenges like Intel and has been steadily led by the same CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, over the past seven years. In 2023, Intel's revenue declined 14% -- representing its second consecutive year of declining revenue -- as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 37%. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to drop 4% and 75%, respectively, in 2024. Based on those estimates, which could still shift based on Intel's potential divestments of its foundry and non-core businesses, the company's stock still doesn't look like a screaming bargain at 22 times forward earnings. In fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue plunged 49%, and the company posted an adjusted net loss as the memory market burned out. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue jumped 62% as it turned profitable again. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect the company's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 52% and 585%, respectively, as a new growth cycle begins. Its growth will inevitably cool off again as it laps that recovery, but its stock looks dirt cheap right now at 12 times forward earnings. Based on these facts, I believe Micron will remain a better buy than Intel for the foreseeable future. Micron is still in the early stages of a new growth cycle, but Intel faces a major crisis that could eventually derail its entire business. Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Intel Corporation ( NASDAQ:INTC ) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20% in the last month. But...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-three-earnings-decline-intel-130047007.html?.tsrc=rss,"Mon, 14 Oct 2024 13:00:47 +0000",The past three-year earnings decline for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) likely explains shareholders long-term losses,"Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20% in the last month. But that is small recompense for the exasperating returns over three years. In that time, the share price dropped 57%. So it is really good to see an improvement. The rise has some hopeful, but turnarounds are often precarious. The recent uptick of 5.3% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals.  View our latest analysis for Intel  In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. Intel became profitable within the last five years. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too. Arguably the revenue decline of 16% per year has people thinking Intel is shrinking. And that's not surprising, since it seems unlikely that EPS growth can continue for long in the absence of revenue growth. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Intel We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Intel's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Intel's TSR of was a loss of 53% for the 3 years. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends. Intel shareholders are down 34% for the year, but the market itself is up 35%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Intel better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Intel  you should be aware of. Intel is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The third quarter experienced significant gains for U.S. equities, which recovered from a fear of slowing economic growth that had driven several asset markets into correction territory. A broad rebound was then induced by a 50 basis point interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. The Russell 1000 Value Index generated a gain of 9.43% for the quarter. Against this backdrop, the ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy underperformed the benchmark Russell 1000 Value Index during the quarter. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy highlighted stocks like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services. The one-month return of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was 12.67%, and its shares lost 35.56% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 11, 2024, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock closed at $23.56 per share with a market capitalization of $100.743 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: ""While the market environment clearly was a headwind in the third quarter, several of our large positions also faced challenging conditions, which negatively impacted results. In the information technology (IT) sector, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has come under additional pressure due to continued softness in the companys core PC and server markets as well as concerns on the companys longer-term competitive position. While Intels turnaround is not happening overnight, we are constructive on the outlook into 2025: the companys product positioning should be much improved and it should be positioned to gain market share in a cyclical upswing in which it has strong earnings power. A somewhat adverse spending environment due to AI myopia has weighed on shares, but we still think the market is undershipping PCs and general servers following a COVID normalization period that saw demand get pulled ahead and then languish as companies froze IT budgets. The installed base is now getting older, and we expect a strong refresh cycle into next year. The delay is actually beneficial to Intel, whose product positioning will be all the more improved. While our investment case is not predicated on an M&A transaction, and we believe one is unlikely, the expression of interest in the company speaks to the value of the assets, which we think still trade at a meaningful discount to fair value.""

Intel and Nvidia are part of the Zacks Investment Ideas article.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-103400426.html?.tsrc=rss,"Mon, 14 Oct 2024 10:34:00 +0000",Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Intel and Nvidia,"Chicago, IL  October 14, 2024  Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intel INTC and Nvidia NVDA. Intel shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let's take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance. Still, it's worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Cost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August. Are Intel Shares a Buy? Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. It's worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidia's sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.

 Key Points This AI stock has delivered impressive gains in 2024, and it could pop higher following its upcoming quarterly report. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a central role in lifting semiconductor stocks over the past couple of years, which is evident from the tremendous 131% spike in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index during this period. The good part is that the proliferation of this technology is set to drive stronger growth in this market, as AI adoption moves from data centers to edge devices such as smartphones, personal computers (PCs), and automotive applications, among others. For instance, the market for chips used in smartphones is expected to jump from $104 billion in 2023 to $146 billion next year. PC semiconductor spending, on the other hand, could jump to $107 billion in 2025 from $89 billion last year, while automotive market chip spending is forecast to jump to $104 billion next year from $79 billion last year. Meanwhile, spending on semiconductors deployed in AI servers and data centers is set to jump from $78 billion in 2023 to $136 billion next year. For investors looking to capitalize on all these fast-growing semiconductor end markets that have received a big boost thanks to AI, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.33%), popularly known as TSMC, seems like an ideal bet. The foundry giant serves all the verticals discussed, and the latest news from the company reinforces the fact that AI is turning out to be a solid growth driver for the company. Let's look at the reasons why. TSMC has just released its sales data for September, and the company has reported an impressive year-over-year increase of almost 40% in its monthly revenue to 251.8 billion New Taiwan (NT) Dollars. If we add the monthly revenue for July, August, and September, TSMC's Q3 revenue would come in at almost 760 billion NT Dollars, an impressive jump of 39% from the same period last year. That number is higher than analysts' Q3 revenue estimates of 748 billion NT Dollars. So, TSMC seems set to exceed Wall Street's expectations when it releases its third-quarter results on Oct. 17. Analysts have been forecasting $1.80 per share in earnings from the company, a jump of 40% from the same period last year, but the better-than-expected revenue growth is likely to translate into stronger bottom-line gains. Another thing worth noting is that TSMC's revenue in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 32% from the same period last year. This means TSMC is well on course to outpace the 26% revenue growth to $87.2 billion that analysts are expecting the company to deliver in 2024. More importantly, TSMC is expected to sustain healthy growth levels over the next couple of years as well.  TSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts However, don't be surprised to see TSMC's revenue growth outpacing Wall Street's expectations. That's because the company is one of the most important pick-and-shovel plays in the massive AI space. It manufactures and fabricates chips for a range of fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. Even better, chipmakers with fabrication plants of their own, such as Intel, are also turning to TSMC to capitalize on the latter's advanced chip manufacturing processes to produce more efficient, powerful chips. But that's not where TSMC's AI-related opportunity ends. The company also manufactures chips for Apple, putting it in position to make the most of the growth in AI smartphone sales. Now, a closer look at the customers discussed will make it clear that TSMC is one of the best ways to play the AI chip boom in different sectors. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, for instance, are trying to make the most of the opportunities available in AI accelerators. Nvidia is running away with this market right now, making chips using TSMC's process nodes to deliver faster performance and lower power consumption than rivals. Qualcomm, AMD, and Intel are present in the AI-enabled PC market. Similarly, Qualcomm and Apple present avenues through which TSMC can tap the smartphone space. And finally, Marvell and Broadcom allow TSMC to tap into another fast-growing niche of AI semiconductors in the form of custom AI chips. Simply stated, it doesn't matter which of these companies wins more market share and ends up dominating their respective niches -- TSMC is most likely going to be the ultimate winner. That's why TSMC's advanced packaging technology that's used for producing AI chips is sold out until 2025. As a result, the company is expanding its capacity to produce AI chips a year ahead of the original schedule, according to Morgan Stanley. This should ideally allow TSMC to make more chips, fulfill more orders, and deliver stronger growth in revenue and earnings. This discussion makes it clear that TSMC is carrying terrific momentum going into its Q3 earnings report that's due on Oct. 17. There is a strong chance that it will beat consensus estimates and also deliver stronger-than-expected guidance for Q4, all of which could give the stock a nice shot in the arm. TSMC stock has jumped 77% this year already, and it looks all set to end the year on a strong note. Given that this AI stock is trading at an attractive 22 times forward earnings even after its outstanding run this year, buying it looks like a no-brainer right now considering that it seems built for more upside. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

The creator of Moore’s law acknowledged it couldn’t “continue forever“—but underestimated how human ingenuity keeps powering advances.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/creator-moore-law-said-couldn-080000132.html?.tsrc=rss,"Sat, 12 Oct 2024 08:00:00 +0000",The creator of Moore’s law said it couldn’t ‘continue forever’—and would be astounded by the chips Intel and its competitors are making now,"Ive bet the whole company on 18A, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told an interviewer earlier this yeara baffling statement to non-techies, but the story behind it is understandable to anyone, and worth knowing. Its an uplifting reminder of human ingenuitys endless reach, relevant to challenges of every kind. As to what on earth Gelsinger was talking about: Intel is one of the worlds preeminent designers and manufacturers of computer chips, and the 18A is a chip that Intel intends to start making in volume next year. It will be the most advanced chip ever, though Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the worlds largest chipmaker, will next year start making in volume a chip it claims at least matches the 18A. That designation, 18A, denotes the density of transistors on the chip, among other things, and the smaller the number, the higher the density. This is the smallest number of any chip yet; 18A means 18 angstroms, an angstrom being one ten-billionth of a meter. The rest of the industry labels chips by nanometers; TSMCs new chip is 2 nm, and by that measure the 18A would be 1.8 nm. Even without understanding the production process, we stand in awe of its infinitesimal scale. Chipmakers now work at the level of atoms. An atom of silicon is 0.21 nanometers wide, for example. Thats enough atomic physics. The important point is that these new chips are more than just astounding. They were supposed to be impossible. The famous Moores law said the number of transistors on a chipbasically transistor densitydoubles every two years or so. It proved accurate for decades, but even Gordon Moore himself acknowledged, It cant continue forever. The laws of physics would allow transistors to get only so small. The crucial question was exactly how small. Experts have been confidently and incorrectly predicting the answer for years. Some said 2010 would be the end, when the leading-edge chip was 28 nm. After chipmakers broke through that level, a new set of prognosticators saw 2020 as the limit, when the leading edge was 5 nm. Yet now even Intels 1.8 nm chip is not the end of the line. The companys next chip1.4 nmis in development. How can this be? The answer is in two parts, both of which are relevant to human ingenuity broadly.  The chipmakers and their suppliers kept finding innovative new ways to extend the life of Moores law, which prognosticators couldnt foresee. For example, chipmakers figured out how to stack transistor components on top of each other, packing more computing power into a given space. Another example: Chipmaking involves shining light through a mask onto a silicon wafer, but as transistors got ever more microscopic, it was difficult to use light with wavelengths short enough to print sharp patterns. ASML, a Dutch maker of chipmaking equipment, developed machines that could handle the necessary extreme ultraviolet light, and todays leading-edge chips cant be made without those machines. To produce the 18A, Intel CEO Gelsinger negotiated with ASML to be first to receive the companys latest model.  Companies went around Moores law. Adding more transistors isnt the only way to get more value from a chip. Advanced algorithms and software now help users get better performance out of their computers chips. Chipmakers are also producing chips designed for specific applications, such as AI. Those chips arent the best at everything, but theyre great for specific tasks. Broadcom, the tech company that has quietly become one of the worlds most valuable companies, designs many such chips. Strictly speaking, Moores law is no longer valid. As transistors approach atomic scale, the number of transistors on a chip isnt doubling every two years. But so what? Computing continues to advance at a scorching pacewith quantum computing and other wonders on the horizonand thats what counts. The saga of Moores law is an example of how we almost always underestimate human ingenuity. Early researchers in computer translation of languages were pessimistic that the field could ever progress beyond its nearly useless state as of the mid-1960s, yet today your phone has a free app that translates to and from over 100 languages very well, and its continually improving. MIT professor Hubert Dreyfus, in a 1972 book called What Computers Cant Do, saw little hope that computers could make significant progress in playing chess beyond the mediocre level then achieved. Yet an IBM computer beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, and Kasparov tells me the free chess app on your phone today is more powerful than the computer that defeated him. Theres no telling what will happen with Pat Gelsingers rescue plan for Intel or with any individual quest. But broadly, over time, we can be sure at least two things will be infinite: human desires and human ingenuity. Well always be unsatisfied, with problems to solve, and well always find astonishing, unexpected solutions to at least some of them. In this tumultuous world, thats not a bad basis for optimism.

"Intel shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. But is it time for investors to revisit the stock?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-intc-shares-worth-another-141500644.html?.tsrc=rss,"Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:15:00 +0000",Are Intel (INTC) Shares Worth Another Look?,"Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Lets take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Still, its worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Cost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August. Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Its worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts.  For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidias sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

Find out what's new with Intel!,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-most-recent-updates-know-140631227.html?.tsrc=rss,"Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:06:31 +0000","Intel's Most Recent Updates That You Need To Know - Oct. 11, 2024","If you belong to the buying the dip strategy fanbase you might be eyeing on Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). So here's a recap of the recent updates with Intel: Q3 report schedule: Intel's third-quarter financial 2024 will be reported on Thursday, October 31, 2024 after the market closes. And they welcome investors and interested parties to join their earnings call at 2 p.m. PDT on the same day to discuss the results. After the freefall of Intel's stock following the Q2 report result, many investors will be seeking for any sign of hope in the next earnings announcement. Overclaim of Intel's new chip: Intel's Core Ultra 200S series, which are scheduled to be on sale October 24; is claimed to consume less power. A review from CNET revealed otherwise that they had an issue with the power consumption when it was advertised as less power consumption than processors from other companies. Next Generation of Xe3 line: Intel announced that they are working on the next generation of Xe3 graphics and next year's Panther Lake tools will be the first to include the graphics. Another round of layoffs: After hiring one new global channel chief, Dave Guzzi, Intel plans to lay off around 15,000 to 19,000 workers next week and the managers have already turned in the lists of the layoffs. Half of the 15,000 cuts are prepared to get their early retirement and separation benefits, but the other 7,500 employees are potentially left with uncertainty. Single-core Arrow Lake chip testing gave solid results: The example of their Arrow Lake Core Ultra 9 285K which was tested as a pre-release engineering sample gave solid results according to PassMark software. The newest report said that Intel's Arrow Lake processors are worth buying. Collaborations: Intel is doing good with their new 18A chip and decided to invest $25 billion in microchip foundry in Israel. They also had signed a multi-year co-investment with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to design custom AI chips, the project worth multi-billion dollars. AI Playground: Intel has launched AI Playground, a platform to do all-in-one AI capabilities like generate pictures from words, improve image quality, answer questions, summarize documents, and translate text. Worrying Q2 report: In the second quarter of this year, Intel reported a $1.6 billion loss with a towering debt of $53 billion and negative cash flow of $12.58 billion in the trailing twelve months. Disruption to ultra-pure quartz supply chain: Pure quartz is essential for semiconductor production, used to melt polysilicon into computer-chip grade silicon. Hurricane Helene disaster damaged the ultra-pure quartz from Spruce Pine in North Carolina and disrupted the quartz supply chain. Certainly there are many other quartz mines in the world but not with the same quality found in the Spruce Pine. Downgrade rating from analysts: On Wall Street, with only one analyst declaring a Buy, other 26 analysts just wait and see with their Hold rating, 6 already downgraded their ratings to Sell. Deutsche Bank is one example firm that lowered their price target on Intel from $27 to $25. No more sales of Gaudi 3 chip: After working on their Gaudi 3 artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chip in the last few years, Intel decided to stop their Gaudi 3 chips sales for 2025. Previously Intel planned to ship around 300,000 Gaudi chips for 2025 but they revoke the intention. Normal operations after processor crashes: Intel's Raptor Lake processors crashed due to high voltage that went to the processors. After the root cause was found, the processor was reported to be on normal operations and no damage occurred. Two new processors: TechRadar reported Intel launched The Granite Rapids processor, marketed with a $17,800 price tag, that came with 128 high-performance cores and can reach speeds of up to 3.9 GHz. And there is the Core Ultra 7 GPU from the Lunar Lake lineup processor. The processor is proved to be significantly faster from the Steam Deck's custom processor. Buybacks no longer attractive: Share buyback plans often increase the share prices. But their buyback as of June 29, 2024, with a total value of $110 billion, no longer leverages their shares price. Out of $110 billion, they had only used $92.76 billion and left $7.24 billion remaining to use to buy back their shares.Don't just read the latest news - make informed investment decisions.

 Key Points The new Arrow Lake chips are far more energy efficient than their predecessors. Chip-giant Intel (INTC -2.71%) has managed to keep pace with rival AMD on raw performance in the PC central processing unit (CPU) market over the past few years, but that feat came at a cost. Intel's previous three generations of desktop PC processors -- Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Raptor Lake Refresh -- were all built on the Intel 7 manufacturing process. Intel 7 is derived from the company's 10-nanometer (nm) process, which was famously delayed for years. In order to deliver enough performance using inferior manufacturing tech, these chips needed to use far more power than the competition. In benchmarks run by Anandtech earlier this year, Intel's last-generation flagship 14900K chip used about 70% more power than the comparable 7950X CPU from AMD. This is a problem for multiple reasons. First, for anyone building a PC, a power-hungry CPU could require a pricier power supply and a more expensive cooling solution, especially if a GPU is involved. Second, Intel ran into instability issues with its two Raptor Lake families, causing some chips to be permanently damaged. The excessive power usage was likely a factor. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Raptor Lake Refresh helped Intel hold its ground in the PC CPU market, but Intel had pushed power consumption about as high as it could reasonably go. With Arrow Lake, officially known as the Core Ultra 200S series, the company has shifted its focus back to power efficiency. Intel chose to use an advanced manufacturing process from TSMC for Arrow Lake, much like it did for its Lunar Lake laptop chips. Arrow Lake was originally meant to be manufactured on the Intel 20A process, but the company decided to shift resources to Intel 18A, instead. Intel uses its Foveros advanced packaging tech for Arrow Lake, but otherwise, the chip is outsourced. A combination of using the TSMC process and architectural improvements has yielded enormous power-efficiency benefits. Arrow Lake is capable of delivering the same performance as Raptor Lake Refresh while using half the power. In productivity use cases, like video calls and office applications, power consumption drops as much as 58%, compared to Raptor Lake Refresh. In gaming workloads, the flagship Arrow Lake chip delivers roughly the same performance as its predecessor, on average, while consuming substantially less power. Depending on the game, Intel's numbers point to a reduction in total system power usage as high as 165W. A typical gaming PC may use around 600W total, so that's an enormous reduction. Lower power consumption also means less heat. Intel points to an average temperature reduction of 13 degrees Celsius, compared to Raptor Lake Refresh in gaming workloads. For those building a gaming PC, high-end Arrow Lake chips can be paired with less-expensive coolers and cases, compared to Raptor Lake Refresh, since there's much less heat to dissipate. While Arrow Lake isn't quite a slam dunk, mostly because the chips don't deliver much in the way of performance gains for gaming, Intel has managed to greatly reduce or eliminate the huge gap in power efficiency between its chips and those from AMD. Arrow Lake also delivers performance gains across a wide array of applications, although we'll have to wait for third-party reviews later this month to get the full picture. Intel has kept AMD to minimal share gains in the desktop PC CPU market over the past few years thanks to Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Raptor Lake Refresh, although the crash in PC sales following the pandemic muddles the picture a bit. As PC sales recover, Arrow Lake should put Intel in a strong competitive position. Timothy Green has positions in Intel.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

Shares of the company, which hosted an event in San Francisco on Thursday, remain up 11% this year. AMD has emerged as the biggest contender to Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for artificial intelligence processors, and Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su argued that its latest chips will exceed some capabilities of its rival. Computer systems based on AMDs MI325X processors will be available soon and have an edge over machines running Nvidias H100, she said at the event. The MI325Xs use of a new type of memory chip will give it better performance at running AI software  a process known as inference  she said. This is an incredibly fast-growing market, Su said during an interview with Bloomberg Televisions Ed Ludlow. We view this as a multiyear opportunity. The Santa Clara, California-based company is trying to crack Nvidias dominance in so-called AI accelerators  chips that have become essential to the development of artificial intelligence systems. Like Nvidia, AMD has committed to bringing out new accelerators every year, stepping up its pace of innovation. Still, AMD has a long way to go to match Nvidia, and Wall Street has been waiting for signs of progress. That may not come until the companys quarterly earnings report, which is expected around the end of this month. Under Su, who just marked her 10th anniversary in the top job at AMD, the company has eclipsed its longtime nemesis Intel Corp. in market valuation. But both companies were caught off guard by how ferociously the industry embraced AI accelerators. Of the two, AMD has responded far more quickly and established itself as the closest rival to Nvidia. AMD has set a target of $4.5 billion of revenue from the new type of chips for this year, a rapid increase. Su has said the overall market for such chips will hit $400 billion in 2027. On Thursday, she said that the company expects that number to reach $500 billion in 2028. At the event, Su also said the company is releasing a new line of server processors based on its Turin technology, making a fresh push into a market once dominated by Intel. Computers are going on sale with AMDs fifth-generation EPYC central processing units, or CPUs, she said. The chips have as many as 192 processor cores and can outperform the latest Intel products, she said. The company said that it now has 34% of the market for this category of chips when measured by revenue. Though Intel still dominates the segment, it once had a 99% share. Su said that she expects continued growth in demand for AI and that the industry is still just getting started in its use of the new technology. Separately, Su said AMD has no current plans to change the suppliers it uses for cutting-edge manufacturing. But the company wants more geographical diversity in terms of its production, and is looking to work with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.s new Arizona facility. Su refused to rule out using either Samsung Electronics Co. or Intel in the future. She said AMD is keeping an open mind. Were always looking at the manufacturing landscape and will always think about how we can have the most resilient supply chain, she said in the Bloomberg Television interview. AMD has a different strategy than Nvidia and its resonating with customers, Su said. Her larger competitor is offering complete systems, including models and software, that AMD believes are closed and proprietary. AMD is far more open to working with other companies, even Intel and Nvidia, she said. The difference is that we dont think were the only ones who have good ideas, she said. --With assistance from Ed Ludlow. (Updates with CEO interview remarks starting in fourth paragraph.)

AMD showed off a number of new AI chips during its Advancing AI event in California on Thursday.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html?.tsrc=rss,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 18:00:32 +0000","AMD debuts latest AI chips as it battles rivals Nvidia, Intel","AMD (AMD) debuted its latest artificial intelligence chips during its Advancing AI 2024 event in San Francisco, Calif., on Thursday. The flurry of announcements comes as AMD continues to battle AI market leader Nvidia (NVDA) and looks to take greater market share from longtime rival Intel (INTC) in the server CPU space. The company showed off its new 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing units (CPU) for servers, provided details on its Instinct MI325X AI accelerator, and showed off its Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for AI PCs for enterprise customers. Shares of AMD fell more than 4% in afternoon trading. AMD contended that its top-of-the-line 5th Gen EPYC 9965 chips, which cost $14,813, beat out Intels fifth-generation Xeon server chips  with servers running AMDs processors offering 4x faster video transcoding times; 3.9x improvements in time to insights, the time it takes to turn data into useable information for science and high-performance computing applications; and 1.6x performance per core in virtualized infrastructure. In other words: AMD wants you to know its chip can outpace Intels in certain scenarios. Intel debuted its next-generation Xeon 6 chip in September, but AMD says it hasnt been able to get its hands on the processor to test it against its EPYC chip. On the AI accelerator side, AMD offered more details about its MI325X chip. The company says the data center processor beasts out Nvidias popular H200 AI chip when it comes to memory bandwidth and capacity, with the MI325X providing 256GB of HBM3E, a form of high-bandwidth memory used in AI processors. AMD said the MI325X features 1.8x higher memory capacity than Nvidias H200 and 1.3x more bandwidth. According to the chipmaker, companies including Dell (DELL), Eviden, Gigabyte, HPE (HPE), Lenovo (LNVGF), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) will begin offering MI325-based platforms in the first quarter of 2025. The company also said its gearing up for its MI350X, the follow-up to the MI325X, which will debut in the second half of next year. Nvidia, meanwhile, is working with customers to deploy its next-generation Blackwell-based AI servers. The data center has become the new battlefield for AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, as the companies seek to take advantage of the ongoing AI gold rush and grab as many customers as possible. And thats translated to some big time cash for AMD and Nvidia. In its most recent quarter, AMD reported record Data Center sales of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. Still, thats a far cry from Nvidias Data Center business, which reported revenue of $26.3 billion, jumping 154% year over year. Intel, on the other hand, is contending with a massive turnaround effort as it looks to regain its footing in the data center space. In its most recent quarter, the company reported that its Data Center revenue fell 3% year over year, dropping to $3 billion. The decline is part of a broader trend for Intel, which saw its full-year 2023 Data Center revenue fall a staggering 20% compared to 2022. In addition to its data center offerings, AMD showed off its new Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for enterprise PCs. The company says its high-end version of the PRO 300, the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375, gets 40% better performance and 14% faster productivity performance than Intels Core Ultra 7 165U chip. But the 165U is one of Intels first-generation Core Ultra processors, and the company has already announced its second-generation Core Ultra chips, which Intel says offer both better performance and battery life than its first-generation offerings. Both AMD and Intel are chasing the hope that AI PCs will goose PC sales, as enterprise and commercial customers look to replace the aging PCs they bought at the onset of the pandemic. So far, however, those efforts arent bearing much fruit. According to Gartner, PC shipments fell in the third quarter, despite the hype around AI PCs. Still, with the holiday season around the corner, theres ample opportunity for the companies to pitch consumers on the benefits of AI PCs. Whether customers will listen is another story.

Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs dipped 2.4% year-over-year to 68.8 million units during the third quarter of 2024.,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3f1d3040-b6fe-3558-93f1-7fb39582b802/pc-demand-is-still-weak..html?.tsrc=rss,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 15:53:00 +0000","PC Demand Is Still Weak.

"The PC industry took a step backward as shipments fell in the third quarter, despite hype around AI PCs.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-shipments-fall-in-q3-despite-ai-push-by-microsoft-chipmakers-151502305.html?.tsrc=rss,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 15:15:02 +0000","PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers","The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters  despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan. According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops. Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end. But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA). In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million. The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud. Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesnt seem to be paying off. According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value. Whats more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didnt drive updates in areas like China. Theres still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether thats PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what youre viewing on your screen. Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words. But its not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apples stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet itll be the same for PCs. Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025. At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak, said Kitagawa.

 Key Points AMD, Supermicro, and Microsoft might be compelling alternative AI plays. Over the past decade, Nvidia's (NVDA -4.20%) rally of approximately 29,530% would have turned a $20,000 investment into $5.9 million. That millionaire-making rally was initially driven by the market's robust demand for its gaming GPUs, but its recent growth spurt was sparked by the explosive AI market -- which drove more companies to buy its newest data center GPUs to process complex machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. The market's demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is still outstripping its available supply. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% and 56%, respectively, from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 36 times next year's earnings -- but it could still face more unpredictable regulatory, macro, and competitive headwinds. Image source: Getty Images. So while Nvidia is a great long-term investment in the long-term expansion of the AI market, it might be smart for investors to look beyond the sector's bellwether and check out a few other underappreciated AI stocks. I believe these three other millionaire-making AI stocks are compelling alternatives to Nvidia right now: AMD (AMD -4.67%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.03%), and Microsoft (MSFT -0.42%). In 2014, AMD's stock dropped to $3 as it failed to keep up with Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market. But if you had invested $20,000 in AMD back then, your investment would be worth $1.1 million today. AMD bounced back under CEO Lisa Su, who drove the chipmaker to sell more custom APUs (which merge CPUs and GPUs) for gaming consoles, design more powerful and more power-efficient chips, and shift its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. It also acquired the programmable chipmaker Xilinx, rolled out more server chips, and expanded its lineup of data center GPUs for accelerating AI tasks. As AMD turned itself around, Intel struggled with persistent delays, production issues, and chip shortages. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect AMD's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 20% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 102%. That growth should be fueled by its market share gains against Intel in the CPU market, the stable growth of its gaming GPU business, and AI tailwinds for its cheaper data center GPUs. AMD's stock might seem a bit pricey at 50 times next year's earnings -- but its strengths could justify its premium valuation and drive its stock even higher over the next decade. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, was once considered a slow-growth supplier of traditional servers. But if you had invested $20,000 in Supermicro 10 years ago, your investment would have grown to over $2.7 million this March...before shrinking back to about $400,000 today. Supermicro is an underdog in the server market, but it carved out a niche by producing high-end liquid-cooled servers. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which granted it early access to its high-end data center GPUs to produce dedicated AI servers. It now generates over half of its revenue from its AI servers. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 39%, respectively. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times next year's earnings, however, its valuations are being compressed by a short-seller's allegations of accounting issues, a delayed 10-K filing, and rumors of a regulatory probe. Supermicro's stock could bounce back quickly if it resolves those pressing issues. If you'd invested $20,000 in Microsoft 30 years ago, your investment would be worth nearly $2.5 million today. Much of that growth occurred after Satya Nadella took the helm as the tech giant's third CEO in 2014. Under Nadella, Microsoft transformed its desktop-based applications into cloud-based services, expanded Azure's cloud infrastructure platform, and rolled out more mobile versions of its apps for Android and iOS devices. It also expanded its Xbox business, rolled out more hardware devices, and tightly integrated OpenAI's generative AI tools into its ecosystem. That forward-thinking transformation turned Microsoft into a growth stock again. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in June 2027), analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at CAGRs of 14% and 15%, respectively, as its cloud, mobile, AI, and gaming businesses continue to flourish. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times next year's earnings, and it could be a much more balanced play on the AI market than Nvidia. Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
