Most Read from Bloomberg How Mexico City Averted AllOut Drought Inside the Utopias of Mexico City Dubais Allure to Expats Is Weighing on Citys Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistans Capital Is No Longer Working What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral The company, backed by Intel Corp., is selling 1.36 billion shares at HK3.73 to HK3.99 each, according to its listing document dated Wednesday. It will start taking orders Wednesday, and shares are due to start trading Oct. 24. Cornerstone investors, which commit to hold shares for at least six months, have agreed to buy about 220 million of Horizon Robotics stock in the offering. The company said the cornerstones include units of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., as well as a fund tied to the government of the Chinese city of Ningbo, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. Horizon Robotics IPO is now set to raise more than initially reported, in a positive signal to investors who have seen IPOs dry up during Chinas economic downturn. The company joins other Chinese firms that are testing the mood of Hong Kongs IPO scene after a recent rally in the countrys shares. Founded in 2015, Horizon Robotics is controlled by Kai Yu, an artificialintelligence scientist who used to work at Baidu and was instrumental in its push into autonomous driving. Chinese companies related to autonomous driving that are gearing up to go public include Pony.ai, which has gotten approval from China for its US listing, and Shanghai Westwell Lab Information Technology Co., which Bloomberg News in August reported was eyeing a raise of as much as 100 million in Hong Kong. However, the market hasnt been completely smooth for such companies. In August, shares of Black Sesame International Holding Ltd., which specializes in chips used in autonomousdriving systems, slumped on their debut. Theyre still down about 8 from their IPO price. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and China Securities International are joint sponsors of the Horizon Robotics IPO.

        "prompt": "Title: ASML's lowered outlook suggests factory overcapacity, not chip doom\nPublished: Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:42:47 +0000\nArticle: By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis (Reuters) Computer chip equipment maker ASML's deep cuts to its 2025 sales forecast sparked a selloff in chip stocks on Tuesday over worries that global chip demand may be faltering. The weaker outlook could, instead, reflect some overcapacity at chip factories that had already stocked up on ASML's pricey tools during the pandemic and have become better at using them to produce a larger numbers of chips, analysts said. ASML's stock plummeted to its biggest singleday loss in a quarter century on its downgraded forecast. In results that the company inadvertently posted a day ahead of schedule, ASML said it expects 2025 total net sales of 30 billion35 billion euros, near the bottom of its previous forecast. That dragged down a large swath of the semiconductor industry because ASML has a nearmonopoly on critical tools used by TSMC, Intel, and Samsung Electronics to make advanced chips. Spurred by blockbuster demand for chips during the pandemic, these chipmakers built extra capacity. That growth stabilized as supply chains eased, leaving them to wait to order new tools until their factories looked ready to overflow with orders. ASML's forecast was a lagging indicator of what has been playing out at these chip factories for months, analysts said. The company said in a statement that despite a boom in AIrelated chips, other parts of the semiconductor market were weaker for longer than expected, leading companies that make logic chips to delay orders and customers that make memory chips to only plan \"limited\" new capacity additions. Intel, TSMC and Samsung are pulling back on orders from ASML because they have realized there is plenty of capacity, said Dan Hutcheson, vice chair at analyst firm TechInsights. Chip factory usage is around 81 this year, but manufacturers tend to buy tools when that gets into the mid90 range, Hutcheson said. Intel has slowed down its factory expansion, which suggests Samsung and TSMC will also be cautious, he said. Chip stockpiles remain high, and chipmakers have become more efficient with ASML's tools, meaning they can make more chips without having to order more. Handel Jones, CEO of International Business Strategies, which tracks the chipmaking industry, has slashed the number of steps where ASML's flagship machines are used, sometimes by almost a third. Jones said Samsung, for example, may be able to use cutting edge chipetching technology to reduce the number of steps using ASML's flagship machines from five or six down to one or two. If successful, Samsung could have significant excess capacity for those machines, known as extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, he said. Jones said he had not changed any of his overall chip industry forecasts, which call for booming demand for AI chips and AIspecific memory chips. \"This is a shortterm blip. In the long term, it's going to be okay,\" Jones said. (Reporting by Max A.

        "prompt": "Title: Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move\nPublished: Tue, 15 Oct 2024 21:00:30 +0000\nArticle: (Bloomberg) Qualcomm Inc. is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp., people familiar with the matter said. Most Read from Bloomberg How Mexico City Averted AllOut Drought Inside the Utopias of Mexico City Dubais Allure to Expats Is Weighing on Citys Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistans Capital Is No Longer Working What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral San Diegobased Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and Americas relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said. A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life from smartphones to electric vehicles would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel. Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasnt received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said. Intel is at the heart of the US governments plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an allAmerican combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report thirdquarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential targets stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of 1 billion for Intel. Qualcomms deliberations are ongoing and theres no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didnt respond to requests for comment. Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it. Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibilliondollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

Learn More Key Points Bad news from ASML weighed on the chip sector. Shares of Intel (INTC 3.33) were falling today as the struggling chip stock got swept up in a broader sector selloff after industry bellwether ASML (ASML 16.26) gave a downbeat forecast for 2025. As of 3:16 p.m. ET, Intel stock was down 3.3 on the news. Image source: Getty Images. ASML is a key company to watch in the semiconductor industry, especially for foundry operators like Intel, as ASML supplies them with topoftheline lithography machines to make semiconductors. This morning, in its thirdquarter earnings report, ASML said the expected recovery in demand for its machines is taking longer than expected, citing weakness in logic and memory chips. Intel competes in logic chips but sold its memory business a few years ago. Intel's foundry operations are surrounded by uncertainty following the company's restructuring announcement in August, which includes laying off at least 15 of its workforce. Intel did score a win last month when it announced a deal to make a custom artificial intelligence (AI) fabric chip for Amazon. However, the ASML news signals that growth in the foundry industry could be more sluggish than investors had hoped. This would likely impact Intel as the company has major ambitions for its new foundry services business. Elsewhere, the company also announced a partnership with AMD to form an advisory group on the x86 central processing unit (CPU) architecture they share. The move seems designed to push back on Arm Holdings, which dominates smartphone CPU market share due to its powerefficient architecture and has been taking market share from Intel and AMD. Any sectorlevel or macro headwinds will be especially problematic for Intel as the company is already struggling to turn a profit and is losing billions a quarter in its foundry division. While there is potential for a comeback, Intel can ill afford anything to go wrong at this point, whether that's internally or outside of its control.

Intel invented what is known as the x86 computing architecture, a technology that for 40 years has powered the world's laptops, PCs and data center servers. AMD licenses the technology from Intel and also makes chips using x86, competing directly against Intel under a longstanding legal settlement. But the market share of both firms has been eroded by Arm, which licenses a competing architecture for computing to laptop chip designers such as Apple and Qualcomm, as well as to firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet that use it in data centers. Part of Arm's successful rise stems from rules in its contracts that all Arm chips be able to run all Arm software, regardless of who made the chip. By contrast, Intel and AMD use the same underlying x86 technology in their chips, but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. On Tuesday, the two companies said they were forming an \"advisory group\" to change that, with Broadcom, Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group and Oracle, among others, joining as founding members.

        "prompt": "Title: Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\nPublished: Tue, 15 Oct 2024 13:00:17 +0000\nArticle: Intel (INTC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned 12.1 over the past month versus the Zacks SP 500 composite's 4.3 change. The Zacks Semiconductor General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 15.2 over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buyandhold decisionmaking. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sellside analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and shortterm stock price movements. Intel is expected to post a loss of 0.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a yearoveryear change of 107.3. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 6.7. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of 0.27 points to a change of 74.3 from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed 0.8. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of 1.08 indicates a change of 302.7 from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed 0.9. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's nearterm price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank 4 (Sell) for Intel. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of 13.01 billion for the current quarter points to a yearoveryear change of 8.1. The 52.18 billion and 55.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of 3.8 and 6.2, respectively. Intel reported revenues of 12.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a yearoveryear change of 0.9. EPS of 0.02 for the same period compares with 0.13 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0.7. The EPS surprise was 80. Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as pricetoearnings (PE), pricetosales (PS) and pricetocash flow (PCF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank 4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Learn More Key Points Which of these chipmakers is the better investment right now? Intel (INTC 3.33) and Micron Technology (MU 3.71) both provide essential chips for modern computers and data centers. Intel is the world's top producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, and Micron is a leading supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips. Both chipmakers manufacture most of their own chips at their internal foundries. But over the past five years, Intel's stock plunged 55 as Micron's stock soared 137. Let's see why Micron outperformed Intel by such a wide margin and if it's still a better overall investment in the growing semiconductor sector. Image source: Getty Images. Three big blunders caused Intel's recent crisis: As Intel struggled with product delays and chip shortages, many PC makers pivoted toward Advanced Micro Devices, which outsourced its production to TSMC's superior chip foundries. Instead of laying out a clear turnaround strategy, Intel went through jarring strategic shifts under three different CEOs over the past six years. Intel's current CEO Pat Gelsinger initially believed the chipmaker could expand its foundries to catch up to TSMC by 2025, but the dismal yields for its newest 18A chips indicate it will broadly miss that target. Earlier this year, Intel laid off 15 of its workforce and suspended its dividend. It's also reportedly considering a spinoff or sale of its foundry unit, which would raise a lot of cash but completely reverse Gelsinger's original plans. For now, Intel is struggling to hold off AMD in the x86 CPU market as it ramps up its production of its lowermargin \"AI CPUs\" (which add more AI processing features to its chips) to remain relevant in the AI race. However, those chips still can't process AI tasks as rapidly as Nvidia's standalone GPUs. Micron isn't the world's biggest producer of DRAM and NAND chips but develops denser chips than its larger competitors. That technological edge makes it a preferred memorychip supplier for highend PCs, servers, and other devices. Micron's business is more cyclical than Intel's. The memory chip market generally goes through boomandbust cycles. The latest bust occurred in 2023 as PC shipments fizzled out, the 5G upgrade cycle for smartphones ended, and many data centers prioritized their purchases of AIoriented GPUs over new memory chips. This year, however, a fresh growth cycle kicked off as the PC and smartphone markets stabilized. Data centers also bought more solidstate drives (SSDs) and highbandwidth memory (HBM) chips to support the demanding needs of new AI applications. Micron expects the AI market's secular expansion to fuel its longterm growth. Micron faces some competitive pressure from bigger chipmakers like Samsung and SK Hynix. China also banned Micron's chips from its infrastructure projects last year, and it could face more headwinds if the tech war between the U.S. and China intensifies. But Micron doesn't face any existential challenges like Intel and has been steadily led by the same CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, over the past seven years. In 2023, Intel's revenue declined 14 representing its second consecutive year of declining revenue as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 37. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to drop 4 and 75, respectively, in 2024. Based on those estimates, which could still shift based on Intel's potential divestments of its foundry and noncore businesses, the company's stock still doesn't look like a screaming bargain at 22 times forward earnings. In fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue plunged 49, and the company posted an adjusted net loss as the memory market burned out. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue jumped 62 as it turned profitable again. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect the company's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 52 and 585, respectively, as a new growth cycle begins. Its growth will inevitably cool off again as it laps that recovery, but its stock looks dirt cheap right now at 12 times forward earnings. Based on these facts, I believe Micron will remain a better buy than Intel for the foreseeable future. Micron is still in the early stages of a new growth cycle, but Intel faces a major crisis that could eventually derail its entire business. Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "prompt": "Title: The past threeyear earnings decline for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) likely explains shareholders longterm losses\nPublished: Mon, 14 Oct 2024 13:00:47 +0000\nArticle: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20 in the last month. But that is small recompense for the exasperating returns over three years. In that time, the share price dropped 57. So it is really good to see an improvement. The rise has some hopeful, but turnarounds are often precarious. The recent uptick of 5.3 could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Intel In his essay The Superinvestors of GrahamandDoddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. Intel became profitable within the last five years. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too. Arguably the revenue decline of 16 per year has people thinking Intel is shrinking. And that's not surprising, since it seems unlikely that EPS growth can continue for long in the absence of revenue growth. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Intel We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Intel's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spinoffs. Intel's TSR of was a loss of 53 for the 3 years. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends. Intel shareholders are down 34 for the year, but the market itself is up 35. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8 over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Intel better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Intel you should be aware of. Intel is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The third quarter experienced significant gains for U.S. equities, which recovered from a fear of slowing economic growth that had driven several asset markets into correction territory. A broad rebound was then induced by a 50 basis point interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. The Russell 1000 Value Index generated a gain of 9.43 for the quarter. Against this backdrop, the ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy underperformed the benchmark Russell 1000 Value Index during the quarter. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.

The onemonth return of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was 12.67, and its shares lost 35.56 of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 11, 2024, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock closed at 23.56 per share with a market capitalization of 100.743 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: \"While the market environment clearly was a headwind in the third quarter, several of our large positions also faced challenging conditions, which negatively impacted results. In the information technology (IT) sector, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has come under additional pressure due to continued softness in the companys core PC and server markets as well as concerns on the companys longerterm competitive position. While Intels turnaround is not happening overnight, we are constructive on the outlook into 2025: the companys product positioning should be much improved and it should be positioned to gain market share in a cyclical upswing in which it has strong earnings power. A somewhat adverse spending environment due to AI myopia has weighed on shares, but we still think the market is undershipping PCs and general servers following a COVID normalization period that saw demand get pulled ahead and then languish as companies froze IT budgets. The installed base is now getting older, and we expect a strong refresh cycle into next year. The delay is actually beneficial to Intel, whose product positioning will be all the more improved. While our investment case is not predicated on an MA transaction, and we believe one is unlikely, the expression of interest in the company speaks to the value of the assets, which we think still trade at a meaningful discount to fair value.\" A technician soldering components for a semiconductor board.

Intel shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction postearnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the SP 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let's take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank 4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the 0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85 over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for nearterm share performance. Still, it's worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly 250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that secondhalf trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Costcutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a 10 billion costsavings target earlier in August. Are Intel Shares a Buy? Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of 0.03 per share. It's worth noting that INTC shares have been redhot over the last month, gaining nearly 20. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AIfavorite Nvidia. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidia's sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Learn More Key Points This AI stock has delivered impressive gains in 2024, and it could pop higher following its upcoming quarterly report. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a central role in lifting semiconductor stocks over the past couple of years, which is evident from the tremendous 131 spike in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index during this period. The good part is that the proliferation of this technology is set to drive stronger growth in this market, as AI adoption moves from data centers to edge devices such as smartphones, personal computers (PCs), and automotive applications, among others. For instance, the market for chips used in smartphones is expected to jump from 104 billion in 2023 to 146 billion next year. PC semiconductor spending, on the other hand, could jump to 107 billion in 2025 from 89 billion last year, while automotive market chip spending is forecast to jump to 104 billion next year from 79 billion last year. Meanwhile, spending on semiconductors deployed in AI servers and data centers is set to jump from 78 billion in 2023 to 136 billion next year. For investors looking to capitalize on all these fastgrowing semiconductor end markets that have received a big boost thanks to AI, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.64), popularly known as TSMC, seems like an ideal bet. The foundry giant serves all the verticals discussed, and the latest news from the company reinforces the fact that AI is turning out to be a solid growth driver for the company. Let's look at the reasons why. TSMC has just released its sales data for September, and the company has reported an impressive yearoveryear increase of almost 40 in its monthly revenue to 251.8 billion New Taiwan (NT) Dollars. If we add the monthly revenue for July, August, and September, TSMC's Q3 revenue would come in at almost 760 billion NT Dollars, an impressive jump of 39 from the same period last year. That number is higher than analysts' Q3 revenue estimates of 748 billion NT Dollars. So, TSMC seems set to exceed Wall Street's expectations when it releases its thirdquarter results on Oct. 17. Analysts have been forecasting 1.80 per share in earnings from the company, a jump of 40 from the same period last year, but the betterthanexpected revenue growth is likely to translate into stronger bottomline gains. Another thing worth noting is that TSMC's revenue in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 32 from the same period last year. This means TSMC is well on course to outpace the 26 revenue growth to 87.2 billion that analysts are expecting the company to deliver in 2024. More importantly, TSMC is expected to sustain healthy growth levels over the next couple of years as well. TSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts However, don't be surprised to see TSMC's revenue growth outpacing Wall Street's expectations. That's because the company is one of the most important pickandshovel plays in the massive AI space. It manufactures and fabricates chips for a range of fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. Even better, chipmakers with fabrication plants of their own, such as Intel, are also turning to TSMC to capitalize on the latter's advanced chip manufacturing processes to produce more efficient, powerful chips. But that's not where TSMC's AIrelated opportunity ends. The company also manufactures chips for Apple, putting it in position to make the most of the growth in AI smartphone sales. Now, a closer look at the customers discussed will make it clear that TSMC is one of the best ways to play the AI chip boom in different sectors. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, for instance, are trying to make the most of the opportunities available in AI accelerators. Nvidia is running away with this market right now, making chips using TSMC's process nodes to deliver faster performance and lower power consumption than rivals. Qualcomm, AMD, and Intel are present in the AIenabled PC market. Similarly, Qualcomm and Apple present avenues through which TSMC can tap the smartphone space. And finally, Marvell and Broadcom allow TSMC to tap into another fastgrowing niche of AI semiconductors in the form of custom AI chips. Simply stated, it doesn't matter which of these companies wins more market share and ends up dominating their respective niches TSMC is most likely going to be the ultimate winner. That's why TSMC's advanced packaging technology that's used for producing AI chips is sold out until 2025. As a result, the company is expanding its capacity to produce AI chips a year ahead of the original schedule, according to Morgan Stanley. This should ideally allow TSMC to make more chips, fulfill more orders, and deliver stronger growth in revenue and earnings. This discussion makes it clear that TSMC is carrying terrific momentum going into its Q3 earnings report that's due on Oct. 17. There is a strong chance that it will beat consensus estimates and also deliver strongerthanexpected guidance for Q4, all of which could give the stock a nice shot in the arm. TSMC stock has jumped 77 this year already, and it looks all set to end the year on a strong note. Given that this AI stock is trading at an attractive 22 times forward earnings even after its outstanding run this year, buying it looks like a nobrainer right now considering that it seems built for more upside.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the SP 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12month earnings estimates, surpassing its longterm average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming thirdquarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

        "prompt": "Title: Intel Corporation (INTC) Faces Uncertainty Ahead of Q3 Earnings as Workforce Cuts and Foundry Split Plans Raise Concerns, Bank of America Maintains Underperform Rating\nPublished: Sat, 12 Oct 2024 10:22:30 +0000\nArticle: We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloudbased AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around 160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to 2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including realtime response capabilities without requiring a highspeed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50 of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, taskspecific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often opensource and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed 700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

        "prompt": "Title: The creator of Moores law said it couldnt continue foreverand would be astounded by the chips Intel and its competitors are making now\nPublished: Sat, 12 Oct 2024 08:00:00 +0000\nArticle: Ive bet the whole company on 18A, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told an interviewer earlier this yeara baffling statement to nontechies, but the story behind it is understandable to anyone, and worth knowing. Its an uplifting reminder of human ingenuitys endless reach, relevant to challenges of every kind. As to what on earth Gelsinger was talking about: Intel is one of the worlds preeminent designers and manufacturers of computer chips, and the 18A is a chip that Intel intends to start making in volume next year. It will be the most advanced chip ever, though Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the worlds largest chipmaker, will next year start making in volume a chip it claims at least matches the 18A. That designation, 18A, denotes the density of transistors on the chip, among other things, and the smaller the number, the higher the density. This is the smallest number of any chip yet; 18A means 18 angstroms, an angstrom being one tenbillionth of a meter. The rest of the industry labels chips by nanometers; TSMCs new chip is 2 nm, and by that measure the 18A would be 1.8 nm. Even without understanding the production process, we stand in awe of its infinitesimal scale. Chipmakers now work at the level of atoms. An atom of silicon is 0.21 nanometers wide, for example. Thats enough atomic physics. The important point is that these new chips are more than just astounding. They were supposed to be impossible. The famous Moores law said the number of transistors on a chipbasically transistor densitydoubles every two years or so. It proved accurate for decades, but even Gordon Moore himself acknowledged, It cant continue forever. The laws of physics would allow transistors to get only so small. The crucial question was exactly how small. Experts have been confidently and incorrectly predicting the answer for years. Some said 2010 would be the end, when the leadingedge chip was 28 nm. After chipmakers broke through that level, a new set of prognosticators saw 2020 as the limit, when the leading edge was 5 nm. Yet now even Intels 1.8 nm chip is not the end of the line. The companys next chip1.4 nmis in development. How can this be? The answer is in two parts, both of which are relevant to human ingenuity broadly. The chipmakers and their suppliers kept finding innovative new ways to extend the life of Moores law, which prognosticators couldnt foresee. For example, chipmakers figured out how to stack transistor components on top of each other, packing more computing power into a given space. Another example: Chipmaking involves shining light through a mask onto a silicon wafer, but as transistors got ever more microscopic, it was difficult to use light with wavelengths short enough to print sharp patterns. ASML, a Dutch maker of chipmaking equipment, developed machines that could handle the necessary extreme ultraviolet light, and todays leadingedge chips cant be made without those machines. To produce the 18A, Intel CEO Gelsinger negotiated with ASML to be first to receive the companys latest model. Companies went around Moores law. Adding more transistors isnt the only way to get more value from a chip. Advanced algorithms and software now help users get better performance out of their computers chips. Chipmakers are also producing chips designed for specific applications, such as AI. Those chips arent the best at everything, but theyre great for specific tasks. Broadcom, the tech company that has quietly become one of the worlds most valuable companies, designs many such chips. Strictly speaking, Moores law is no longer valid. As transistors approach atomic scale, the number of transistors on a chip isnt doubling every two years. But so what? Computing continues to advance at a scorching pacewith quantum computing and other wonders on the horizonand thats what counts. The saga of Moores law is an example of how we almost always underestimate human ingenuity. Early researchers in computer translation of languages were pessimistic that the field could ever progress beyond its nearly useless state as of the mid1960s, yet today your phone has a free app that translates to and from over 100 languages very well, and its continually improving. MIT professor Hubert Dreyfus, in a 1972 book called What Computers Cant Do, saw little hope that computers could make significant progress in playing chess beyond the mediocre level then achieved. Yet an IBM computer beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, and Kasparov tells me the free chess app on your phone today is more powerful than the computer that defeated him. Theres no telling what will happen with Pat Gelsingers rescue plan for Intel or with any individual quest. But broadly, over time, we can be sure at least two things will be infinite: human desires and human ingenuity. Well always be unsatisfied, with problems to solve, and well always find astonishing, unexpected solutions to at least some of them. In this tumultuous world, thats not a bad basis for optimism.

        "prompt": "Title: Are Intel (INTC) Shares Worth Another Look?\nPublished: Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:15:00 +0000\nArticle: Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction postearnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the SP 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Lets take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank 4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the 0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85 over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for nearterm share performance. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Still, its worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly 250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that secondhalf trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Costcutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a 10 billion costsavings target earlier in August. Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelvemonth basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of 0.03 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay uptodate with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Its worth noting that INTC shares have been redhot over the last month, gaining nearly 20. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AIfavorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidias sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

        "prompt": "Title: Intel's Most Recent Updates That You Need To Know Oct. 11, 2024\nPublished: Fri, 11 Oct 2024 14:06:31 +0000\nArticle: If you belong to the buying the dip strategy fanbase you might be eyeing on Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). So here's a recap of the recent updates with Intel: Q3 report schedule: Intel's thirdquarter financial 2024 will be reported on Thursday, October 31, 2024 after the market closes. And they welcome investors and interested parties to join their earnings call at 2 p.m. PDT on the same day to discuss the results. After the freefall of Intel's stock following the Q2 report result, many investors will be seeking for any sign of hope in the next earnings announcement. Overclaim of Intel's new chip: Intel's Core Ultra 200S series, which are scheduled to be on sale October 24; is claimed to consume less power. A review from CNET revealed otherwise that they had an issue with the power consumption when it was advertised as less power consumption than processors from other companies. Next Generation of Xe3 line: Intel announced that they are working on the next generation of Xe3 graphics and next year's Panther Lake tools will be the first to include the graphics. Another round of layoffs: After hiring one new global channel chief, Dave Guzzi, Intel plans to lay off around 15,000 to 19,000 workers next week and the managers have already turned in the lists of the layoffs. Half of the 15,000 cuts are prepared to get their early retirement and separation benefits, but the other 7,500 employees are potentially left with uncertainty. Singlecore Arrow Lake chip testing gave solid results: The example of their Arrow Lake Core Ultra 9 285K which was tested as a prerelease engineering sample gave solid results according to PassMark software. The newest report said that Intel's Arrow Lake processors are worth buying. Collaborations: Intel is doing good with their new 18A chip and decided to invest 25 billion in microchip foundry in Israel. They also had signed a multiyear coinvestment with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to design custom AI chips, the project worth multibillion dollars. AI Playground: Intel has launched AI Playground, a platform to do allinone AI capabilities like generate pictures from words, improve image quality, answer questions, summarize documents, and translate text. Worrying Q2 report: In the second quarter of this year, Intel reported a 1.6 billion loss with a towering debt of 53 billion and negative cash flow of 12.58 billion in the trailing twelve months. Disruption to ultrapure quartz supply chain: Pure quartz is essential for semiconductor production, used to melt polysilicon into computerchip grade silicon. Hurricane Helene disaster damaged the ultrapure quartz from Spruce Pine in North Carolina and disrupted the quartz supply chain. Certainly there are many other quartz mines in the world but not with the same quality found in the Spruce Pine. Downgrade rating from analysts: On Wall Street, with only one analyst declaring a Buy, other 26 analysts just wait and see with their Hold rating, 6 already downgraded their ratings to Sell. Deutsche Bank is one example firm that lowered their price target on Intel from 27 to 25. No more sales of Gaudi 3 chip: After working on their Gaudi 3 artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chip in the last few years, Intel decided to stop their Gaudi 3 chips sales for 2025. Previously Intel planned to ship around 300,000 Gaudi chips for 2025 but they revoke the intention. Normal operations after processor crashes: Intel's Raptor Lake processors crashed due to high voltage that went to the processors. After the root cause was found, the processor was reported to be on normal operations and no damage occurred. Two new processors: TechRadar reported Intel launched The Granite Rapids processor, marketed with a 17,800 price tag, that came with 128 highperformance cores and can reach speeds of up to 3.9 GHz. And there is the Core Ultra 7 GPU from the Lunar Lake lineup processor. The processor is proved to be significantly faster from the Steam Deck's custom processor. Buybacks no longer attractive: Share buyback plans often increase the share prices. But their buyback as of June 29, 2024, with a total value of 110 billion, no longer leverages their shares price. Out of 110 billion, they had only used 92.76 billion and left 7.24 billion remaining to use to buy back their shares.Don't just read the latest news make informed investment decisions.
