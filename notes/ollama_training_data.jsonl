Constellation Energy has placed an order for a main power transformer valued at 100m, advancing the revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in the US state of Pennsylvania, Reuters has reported. The transformer represents the largest single piece of equipment required for the reactors revival. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Constellation has committed to investing 1.6bn up to 2028 to bring the plant back into operation. The decision to proceed with the restart was made after Constellation conducted a thorough survey of the site to assess the condition of essential infrastructure and equipment. In a strategic move in September 2024, Constellation signed a 20year power contract with Microsoft, which will support the restart efforts. The Three Mile Island reactor, situated on an island in the Susquehanna River, will supply 835MW of power, which will contribute to offsetting the electricity consumption of Microsofts data centres.

Learn More Key Points Philippe Laffont's hedge fund, Coatue Management, has been scooping up shares of Taiwan Semiconductor for several consecutive quarters. Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont is the founder of Coatue Management, one of Wall Street's most prestigious hedge funds. Below, I'm going to explore some of the more interesting moves Coatue has made as of late as it pertains to the firm's artificial intelligence (AI) positions. To locate this information, I've reviewed the firm's Form 13F form. It's an incredibly useful tool for curious investors because it provides a detailed account of buying and selling activity by institutional investors every quarter. During the second quarter, Coatue purchased 1.1 million shares of chip stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 13.12) increasing its stake by 10 and bringing its total position to 11.4 million shares. On the surface, this may seem like a mundane or obvious move. After all, semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners since the AI revolution kicked off a couple of years ago. But here's where things get a little curious check out the table below, and see how Coatue has been treating Nvidia stock. Data source: Hedge Follow. Chart by author. For the past year, Coatue has been a net seller of Nvidia stock. All the while, the fund has nearly doubled its stake in Taiwan Semiconductor (also known as TSMC), increasing its position from 6.8 million shares at the end of the second quarter of 2023 to over 11 million shares currently. On the surface, selling Nvidia stock right now might seem counterintuitive. The company is at the forefront of the AI movement, thanks, in large part, to its blossoming graphics processing units (GPU) business and data center services. Moreover, with Nvidia's new Blackwell series GPUs projected to be yet another home run for the company, why would anyone even consider selling the stock right now? In my opinion, the answer revolves around the longterm narrative. Many of Nvidia's largest customers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are all investing heavily in their own AI infrastructures. While many of these companies will probably remain core customers of Nvidia, there's a reasonable argument to be made that the company's rocketshipstyle growth is going to hit some turbulence as new chipsets hit the market. It's this very construct, however, that could bode well for Taiwan Semiconductor. The company already manufactures products for Amazon, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom, Sony, Qualcomm, and many more. Image source: Getty Images Despite Nvidia's strong influence on the current shape of the GPU market, Taiwan Semiconductor's diversified platform looks better positioned further down the road, as more hardware products are introduced. I think of TSMC as similar to a longterm call option on the need for AIpowered chips. The company is in a position to benefit, regardless of which company's GPUs are witnessing the most demand. The chart below benchmarks TSMC stock against a peer set of other leading semiconductor players on a forward pricetoearnings (PE) basis. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. With a forward PE of 29.1, Taiwan Semiconductor is among the least expensive in this cohort. That's pretty interesting, considering that shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have surged by 112 over the past 12 months. In other words, even with some considerable valuation expansion in a short time frame, Taiwan Semiconductor's outlook doesn't seem to be fetching a commensurate multiple, compared to some of its highgrowth peers. Coatue is making appropriate moves as it relates to chip stocks. The firm has locked in some gains by reducing its Nvidia stake, yet also stands to continue benefiting from any upside, as long as it retains a position in some capacity. Meanwhile, by continuing to bolster its position in Taiwan Semiconductor, Coatue appears to be making a savvy move right now. It could wind up being an even more lucrative decision as the AI narrative takes shape over time.

        "prompt": "Title: First US auction of naturebased carbon credits scheduled for early 2025\nPublished: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 13:54:03 +0000\nArticle: The American Forest Foundation (AFF) recently announced that the nonprofit will hold the US's first naturebased carbon credit auction early next year. In February 2025, buyers will be able to bid on premium carbon credits from four projects under the Family Forest Carbon Program, an initiative that connects landowners with technical and financial resources to more sustainably manage private forest lands. \"We are trying to address several pain points that exist in the current voluntary market for buyers of carbon credits, but also for landowners who are seeking to participate in the market,\" Nate Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the American Forest Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. \"And we're also seeking to close what is a really substantial financing gap for natural climate solutions, a gap that we're going to have to close globally if we're going to stay on a 1.5 or even a twodegree scenario.\" Price volatility, market inefficiency, and a credibility crisis in the voluntary carbon market along with the AI boom and other factors have contributed to the recent trend of companies pulling back from their netzero pledges. Corporations such as Shell (SHEL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Crocs (CROX) have missed, delayed, or weakened their sustainability targets in recent years. Truitt expects interest in the auction from companies in sectors, such as consumer goods that produce high emissions or are relatively less active in carbon markets but have decarbonization strategies in place. He also anticipates some interest from universities. Among companies purchasing carbon credits, Microsoft dominates after setting an ambitious goal in 2020 to become carbonnegative within a decade. Other Big Tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are consistent buyers. However, Truitt doesn't expect Big Tech companies to ultimately participate in this auction as they already employ large procurement teams. Truitt instead sees the auction as attracting \"the next wave of carbon credit buyers,\" comprised of actors that currently must navigate confusing spot markets, sift through individual carbon credit offerings, or sign on to longterm purchase agreements in a largely unregulated market. It's our hope that by lowering these transaction costs and the friction of this, ... we can get some of those buyers to come to the table, Truitt said. AFF is auctioning carbon credits for two types of projects. The first aims to improve forest management and carbon sequestration on 90,000 acres of land from Maine to Alabama held by 700 family landowners enrolled in the project. The second and newer project pays cattle ranchers and pasture owners in Georgia to plant trees on 1,500 acres of land. Another feature of AFF's auction will be an advance funding mechanism. In addition to bidding on the number and price of carbon credits to be delivered at a later date, companies will determine a percentage they are willing to pay for upfront in exchange for a discount. Buyers have spent roughly 3 billion on durable carbon removal credits since October 2019, according to reporting platform CDR.fyi; however, the market could grow more rapidly with better access to lowcost financing. Truitt underscored that many projects are ready to get off the ground. But because these projects involve more risk natural disasters and changing rules around offsets add to uncertainty they often have a difficult time securing lending. If successful, AFF hopes their auction design can be used by other carbon market participants and remove barriers to these transactions. \"We're not solving climate change, but we're trying to develop a tool that will enable the voluntary carbon market to scale quicker and to produce higher quality carbon credits that can be trusted by buyers, investors, and the general public,\" Truitt said. Tim Stout is one landowner participating in the project. Stout and his family own a 175acre former dairy farm in Vermont that was passed down from his greatgrandfather. He and his brother have managed the heavily forested property for the past 40 years, and after evaluating different carbon projects, their family enrolled in the Family Forest Carbon Program. The financial benefits are \"fairly modest,\" Stout said. \"I mean, over 20 years, it's a healthy amount,\" he clarified, \"but I think for ... the program to really take off, the price of carbon credits has to go way up.\" AFF said it uses Verra's verified carbon standard and its own internal methodology developed with the Nature Conservancy to vet the quality of the credits. \"A messy forest is better than a clean forest because ... all the downed trees, all the branches, all the leaf litter is storing carbon,\" Stout explained about how these plans have changed the way he and his family manage their land. \"We're moving more and more to kind of a messy forest.\" At the same time, the cost of managing land has \"gone up significantly,\" Stout said. Extreme weather attributed to climate change has exacerbated costs. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Vermont, which experienced a 1in1,000year rain event this summer, eroded the foundation of Stout's barn, incurring a large expense, he said. And strong winds toppled 200yearold maple trees onto roadways, which needed to be removed. Funding from the auction will go toward expenses related to managing the forest and creating longterm land use plans that are developed by landowners, state foresters, and consulting AFF foresters. These plans and smart forestry techniques help forest owners like Stout increase the amount of carbon their forests can sequester. Stout, who now sits on AFF's board, said he was motivated to sign a contract with the Family Forest Carbon Program by his concerns over climate change. He also feels a strong calling to preserve the woodland for future generations and educate other small landowners about sustainable forestry. \"I would love to have my fouryearold grandson and twoyearold granddaughter be able to visit that land when they're my age and have a healthy, robust, resilient forest that's still playing a role in mitigating climate change,\" he said.

Learn More Key Points This stock can grant investors two benefits (growth and dividends) for the price of one. The artificial intelligence (AI) market is taking off, providing a significant tailwind for several growthoriented companies. However, that doesn't mean incomeseeking investors can't get in on the act. Several AI leaders, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, pay dividends. Which stock provides the best combination of AIrelated growth and an attractive dividend program? In my view, the answer to that question is Microsoft (MSFT 0.20). Read on to find out why. Of the top tech companies benefiting from the rapid rise in AI, several don't pay dividends or have been doing so for less than three years. Amazon is in the former category, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms are in the latter. That does not apply to Nvidia, but the chipmaker's dividend program isn't impressive. Its forward yield is 0.03. In fairness, that's partly because the company's shares have been on fire lately, but investors can look at other things, including the fact that it isn't in the habit of raising its dividends every year. It recently hiked it significantly, so the total growth of its dividend per share over the past decade amounts to 370.6. NVDA Dividend data by YCharts However, Nvidia's quarterly dividend per share is a minuscule 0.01. How does Microsoft compare? It offers a much more attractive forward yield of 0.8, raises its dividends regularly, and has increased its payouts by 167.7 in the past decade. MSFT Dividend data by YCharts Microsoft's quarterly dividend per share of 0.83 is also far higher than those of its similarly sized tech peers, including Nvidia. Lastly, Microsoft's cash payout ratio is just under 30, meaning the company has ample room to continue increasing its dividends. But can Microsoft's business support the payouts for a long time? Microsoft played a role in the ongoing AI gold rush that started with ChatGPT. The tech giant invested in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, back in 2019. Following the chatbot's success, Microsoft doubled down and deepened its relationship with OpenAI. But that's only part of the company's involvement in this niche, and perhaps not the more important part. Microsoft offers a suite of AIrelated services through Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing division. With most companies now seeking at least some of these services, business is booming. In its latest period, the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30), Microsoft noted that Azure continues to be one of its fastestgrowing segments. Microsoft's total revenue increased by 15 year over year to 64.7 billion. Azure's revenue was up 29 compared to the yearago period. But how much did AI contribute to that performance? According to management, quite a bit. Speaking of the cloud market and Azure in particular, CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's earnings conference call, \"Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI.\" This business should continue to provide a major tailwind for Microsoft since AI and cloud computing are both on a growth path. Although these likely represent the tech giant's biggest growth opportunities, there is more to its business. Microsoft remains the runaway leader in the computer operating systems market. It is also a leading player in gaming. The company benefits from a solid moat from multiple sources. Consider the switching costs associated with its suite of productivity tools (Excel, Word, Teams, etc.). Businesses that rely on these products won't easily jump ship for fear of disrupting their daytoday activities. Microsoft also carries one of the most valuable brand names in the world, another potent competitive edge. Microsoft is an innovative company that generates plenty of cash flow and boasts a robust balance sheet, as its AAA rating from Standard Poor's a higher rating than the U.S. government confirms. With Microsoft, investors can get both income and growth, AIrelated or otherwise.

        "prompt": "Title: The AI stock surge signals investors will be patient for profit: Morning Brief\nPublished: Thu, 17 Oct 2024 10:05:00 +0000\nArticle: This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings If the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for techs fall earnings? Judging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense. As analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the markets most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for shortterm worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive. And once again investors are wondering where the limit is if it exists. Third quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate 215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another 250 billion in 2025. A slowdown in investment isnt here yet. But well be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. Its only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and innovative AI use cases come due. The tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized. The tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesnt mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. Thats a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it. Seeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. Thats what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on X hshaban.

Learn More Key Points Griffin aggressively added to his hedge fund's positions in all three of these top AI stocks in Q2. Ken Griffin subscribes to the theory that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. His Citadel hedge fund's portfolio includes over 5,800 holdings. How has this highly diversified strategy worked out for Griffin? Quite well, considering he's currently worth roughly 43 billion. With such a big portfolio, it's not surprising that Griffin owns positions in many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here are his top three AI stocks and whether or not they're good picks to buy now. Amazon (AMZN 0.11) ranks as the largest individual stock holding for Griffin and his thirdlargest holding overall (after two exchangetraded funds). As of June 30, 2024, his hedge fund owned 7.69 million shares of the ecommerce and cloud services giant worth around 1.49 billion. Griffin remains bullish about Amazon, increasing his stake in the stock by nearly 17 in the second quarter of 2024. AI permeates practically every part of Amazon's business. The company uses AI to recommend products for online buyers. Its Alexa is one of the most popular AI assistants. Amazon incorporates AI into its search, boosting ecommerce sales. AI helps the company optimize its warehouse operations. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide array of AI tools to customers. Sure, Amazon (like several of its peers) seemed to be initially caught offguard by the rapid rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AWS also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in providing cloud services. However, Griffin is smart to have invested so heavily in Amazon, in my opinion. The company is a leader in AI with the resources to remain among the strongest players. Despite the challenges from Microsoft and Google Cloud, AWS remains the top cloud services provider. I think Amazon stock is still one of the best AI picks around. Apple (AAPL 0.14) trails behind Amazon as Griffin's secondlargest individual stock holding. Citadel owned 5.47 million shares of the iPhone maker worth 1.15 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This reflected aggressive buying by Griffin in Q2: He increased his hedge fund's position in Apple by 93. I suspect that AI was a major reason why Griffin added so much to Citadel's stake in Apple. The company at long last introduced its generative AI capabilities, which it calls Apple Intelligence. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that Apple Intelligence could ignite a supercycle of iPhone upgrades that provide a big tailwind for Apple. Others aren't so optimistic, though. They think Apple's slow rollout of its generative AI features could backfire. Even if Apple Intelligence does drive incremental growth, much of it could already be baked into Apple's share price with the stock trading at a forward pricetoearnings ratio of close to 30. I agree to some extent with the skeptics who slam Apple's staggered introduction of its Apple Intelligence capabilities. My hunch is we won't see an overwhelming kickoff of an upgrade supercycle this year. However, I nonetheless expect iPhone sales will increase with momentum potentially accelerating in 2026 and 2027. Apple isn't a slamdunk nearterm pick, in my view, but it's still a stock worth buying for longterm investors. Broadcom (AVGO 3.92) is Griffin's thirdlargest AI position and ranks in Citadel's top 10 holdings overall. At the end of Q2, the hedge fund owned 4.84 million shares of the semiconductor and infrastructure software company worth 776.7 million. Griffin increased Citadel's position in Broadcom by roughly 64 in Q2. AI is a huge growth driver for Broadcom. CEO Hock Tan said in September that the company expects to generate 12 billion from AI in fiscal year 2024. That estimate reflects 23 of Broadcom's projected total fullyear revenue. The company has recently launched multiple new AI infrastructure products, including ethernet networking switches designed to accelerate AI workloads. However, Broadcom's growth story isn't as rosy as you might think. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of VMware, the company's revenue increased by only 4 year over year in the latest quarter. But Griffin is bullish about Broadcom. So is Wall Street, with 27 of 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October recommending the stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" I agree with the consensus: Broadcom is a great AI stock to buy and hold.

Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers. Folks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catchall way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchangetraded funds (ETFs) to consider. With a more than 20 stake in Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.79) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees. Image source: Getty Images. The technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the SP 500 (GSPC 0.20) making up 31.7 of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why. Company Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2 Nvidia 14.1 Microsoft 13.9 Broadcom 4.4 Adobe 1.7 Salesforce 1.6 AMD 1.6 Oracle 1.6 Accenture 1.4 Cisco Systems 1.4 Data source: Vanguard. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over 10.5 trillion making the sector very topheavy. And while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9 of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. So, while investors could turn to pureplay semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better longterm investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35 expense ratio compared to just 0.1 for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile. With the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AIdriven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. Amazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off. Vanguard offers a lowcost megacap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap. Nvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time. Meanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend. The fact that the tech sector has a 20 weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend. The best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a lowcost passive approach may prefer the handsoff nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chockfull of semiconductor stocks so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.

Learn More Key Points Investors are about to get a fresh look at Microsoft's artificial intelligence progress. Corporate America is heading into another important earnings season. Wall Street will be especially focused on results from the technology giants that dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) race because they tend to deliver much stronger revenue and earnings growth than the rest of the stock market. Microsoft (MSFT 0.20) is scheduled to release the results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended Sept. 30) on Oct. 30, and investors will be keenly focused on how well it is monetizing its growing portfolio of AI products and services. However, there will be one AI number in Microsoft's report that could be more important than the rest. Image source: Getty Images. Early last year, Microsoft rocked the tech sector by announcing plans to invest another 10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has since used OpenAI's industryleading models to create several AI products, including its Copilot virtual assistants, which are capable of generating text, images, and even computer code in response to simple prompts. Copilot is now embedded for free in most of Microsoft's flagship software, including the Windows operating system, the Edge internet browser, and the Bing search engine. However, the company charges an additional monthly subscription to add Copilot to its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which includes Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Companies worldwide pay for more than 400 million 365 seats, and all of them are potential candidates for Copilot addons, which presents a significant financial opportunity for Microsoft. During its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended June 30), Microsoft said the number of corporate customers that bought more than 10,000 Copilot addons for 365 had doubled from just three months earlier. Investors should look for updates on Copilot numbers in the upcoming quarter. But the Azure cloud computing platform will likely headline the report, thanks mainly to Azure AI. That's the offering that allows businesses and developers to rent data center computing capacity powered by the latest chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, in order to build their own AI models. Azure AI also offers access to the latest large language models (LLMs), including GPT4o from OpenAI, which developers can use to accelerate the creation of AI software applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. At the end of Q4, Azure AI had 60,000 customers which was an impressive 60 increase from a year earlier. The Azure cloud platform has consistently been the fastestgrowing part of Microsoft's entire organization, which is why investors tend to focus on it the most. During Q4, Azure revenue increased 29 year over year, which marked an acceleration from 26 in the prioryear quarter. Azure's growth is increasingly driven by Azure AI. For example, Azure AI was responsible for 8 percentage points of Azure's overall 29 growth during Q4, which was a record high. That represented a whopping eightfold increase from the yearago quarter, when Azure AI contributed just 1 percentage point to the company's topline growth rate. Microsoft spent a whopping 55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Management has already said it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. The revenue generated by Azure AI is one way to measure the payoffs Microsoft (and its investors) are receiving for those significant financial outlays. Suppose Azure AI continues to contribute an increasing share of growth to Azure. That will indicate that businesses and developers are spending money on computing capacity and access to the latest LLMs. Based on Microsoft's trailing 12month earnings per share of 11.80, its stock is trading at a pricetoearnings ratio of 35.5. That's a 10.5 premium to the 32.1 ratio of the Nasdaq100 index, which includes all of Microsoft's bigtech peers. The sheer amount of money Microsoft is spending on AI infrastructure will be a headwind for its earnings for at least the next year. Therefore, if Azure AI continues to make a growing contribution to the Azure cloud platform's results, investors will likely be more comfortable with continuing to support the stock's premium valuation. However, if Azure AI stalls or underwhelms, that could trigger a correction in Microsoft stock. That's why, in my opinion, Azure AI's contribution to Azure's overall revenue growth is the number investors should be watching on Oct. 30.

Learn More Key Points This highflying Vanguard ETF could keep its momentum going. Exchangetraded funds (ETFs) could be seen as the equivalent of the tortoise in Aesop's famous fable of the tortoise and the hare by some investors. Like the fabled tortoise, ETFs win the race but do so by being slow and steady. But not every ETF fits that stereotype. Some funds sprint like Aesop's hare and are big winners for investors. One Vanguard ETF even turned 10,000 into over 28,000 in just five years. Image source: Getty Images. You don't have be a rocket scientist to figure out what kinds of stocks the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.79) focuses on. This Vanguard fund tries to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 2550 Index, which includes only U.S. stocks in the information technology sector. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF currently owns 316 stocks, just one less than its benchmark index. Its top holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. Together, these five stocks make up over half of the ETF's portfolio. The ETF was created in January 2004. Since then, it has delivered an average annual return of 13.55. But it has really taken off over the last five years. During this period, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF's market price has grown by an annual compounded average of around 23.2. Many of the stocks owned by this Vanguard ETF don't pay dividends, but some do. With dividends reinvested, the fund has turned an initial investment of 10,000 five years ago into close to 28,440 today. VGT Total Return Price data by YCharts The most important factor behind the stellar performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. All five of the fund's top holdings have strong AI credentials. Nvidia has been a monster winner due to AI. Its share price has skyrocketed more than 28x over the last five years as customers bought the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) hand over fist to power AI models. Broadcom stock has soared over 520 during the period. The company has emerged as a leader in AI infrastructure. Apple's share price has nearly quadrupled over the last five years. Its big gains in 2024 are largely due to excitement over the company's new generative AI capabilities. Microsoft and Oracle have seen their stocks roughly triple thanks to a big AI tailwind. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF might not have been able to deliver such huge gains, though, during an economic downturn. It's certainly helped that the U.S. and global economies bounced back quickly from the COVID19 pandemic. Many experts predicted the U.S. would enter into a recession over the last couple of years, but the economy remained stronger than expected. We can't leave out the Vanguard ETF's low costs, either. Its annual expense ratio is only 0.1, well below the Lipper peer average of 1.303. The fund's returns would have been lower if its expenses were significantly higher. It's possible that the Vanguard Information Technology ETF won't be able to keep up its strong momentum. Valuation could become a problem. The average pricetoearnings ratio for the stocks in the ETF's portfolio is a skyhigh 35.6. However, this valuation metric should be viewed in the context of the growth generated by the stocks owned by the fund. We're only in the early innings of the AI era. Tech stocks that focus on AI (as all of the Vanguard ETF's top holdings do) could continue delivering exceptional returns for years to come. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be volatile, especially with a handful of stocks accounting for a large percentage of total assets. Perhaps it won't be able to turn a 10,000 investment into more than 28,000 over the next five years. But I think this ETF remains a good pick for longterm investors.

Learn More Key Points Microsoft's capital expenditures have grown by nearly 300 in the past five years. A big growth opportunity in tech these days is undoubtedly in artificial intelligence (AI). The entire AI market could be worth more than 1.8 trillion by the end of the decade, according to estimates from Grand View Research. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of 36.6. For tech companies, that mouthwatering level of growth is what helps justify spending heavily on new technologies. But there's also going to be no shortage of competition in the space. And the announcement that ChatGPT maker OpenAI will incur around 5 billion in losses this year despite generating 3.7 billion in revenue underscores how challenging it may be to turn a profit on AI, especially in the short term. One company that's investing heavily into AI these days is Microsoft (MSFT 0.18). Not only has it invested in OpenAI, but it's also spending money on enhancing its products and services with AI capabilities. How big of a payoff that will have on its bottom line, however, is certainly debatable. Capital expenditures (capex) are what a company spends to add, upgrade, or maintain its assets, for the purpose of growing the business in the long run. It's a discretionary expense and when there's a big growth opportunity, spending can ramp up significantly. In the past five years, Microsoft's capital spending has increased at a far quicker rate than revenue. MSFT Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts This isn't necessarily a cause for concern simply because the goal of increased capital expenditures is greater revenue growth down the road. The big test will be if this high level of spend leads to an acceleration of Microsoft's growth. Microsoft has the resources necessary to invest in AI, but throwing a lot of money at something doesn't mean that it's going to pay off for the business in the future. There are a growing number of AIpowered products and services in the market these days, and Microsoft will need to prove that it has superior products for that to lead to strong revenue growth. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff compares Microsoft's new Copilot AI to the much maligned Clippy of years past. Microsoft recently rolled out an updated version of Copilot, but if it doesn't impress business users and help justify its 30month per user price tag for Microsoft 365, the investments the company is making in AI may not end up being worthwhile. Shares of Microsoft are up a fairly modest 12 this year (the SP 500 has risen by 23) as investors may be growing apprehensive about the stock's valuation and whether AI will be the catalyst the company expects. At 36 times earnings, the tech stock is a bit pricey and its 3.1 trillion valuation means it's one of the most valuable companies in the world. If you're investing for the long run and willing to hold on for years, then Microsoft can still make for a solid buy. Its dominance of office software products, popular Windows operating system, and expansion into gaming are all reasons why the company can continue to do well for the foreseeable future. The one wrinkle, however, is that without a high growth rate, investors may be hesitant to pay a big premium for the stock. And lackluster growth from AI could exacerbate those concerns. I expect the company will eventually figure out what works and what doesn't with respect to AI. Microsoft can afford to make mistakes and experiment along the way. And that's why in the short run, if it underwhelms the market with its Copilot AI, it might struggle, but over the long haul the stock is still likely to rise in value.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at alltime highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice thats a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. Its not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape, he said. Thats sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer. But theres been some cracks in the business cycle, he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at super high levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at alltime highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results, Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the SP 500 plummet and hit alltime lows. AIrelated firms continue to drive market gains, with the SP 500 up 21 yeartodate. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Metas share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand shortterm pressures and deliver longterm value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Microsoft Headquarters Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than 10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analysts upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275 since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 21.71 Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25 market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multibillion gaming industry with Activations Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is wellpositioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AIs customer base increased by almost 60 during that time. The vast majority of Microsofts planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent 55.7 billion, of which 19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the companys earnings will increase by 13 per year. Even though Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a premium with a pricetoearnings multiple of 31, It is one of the most promising stocks given its record in returning shareholder value. The company already pays a 0.80 dividend yield. Additionally, the stock is rated as a strong buy based on 30 Wall Street analysts with an average price target of 504.73, implying a 21.71 change from the last price of 414.71. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to 89.068 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the worlds largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a 135 billion runrate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 clouddelivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsofts leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsofts product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI its suite of AI services is now used by 65 of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7 of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of 5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot its AI code writing service is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40 plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35 quarteroverquarter; and (3) Copilot Studio its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175 quarteroverquarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported betterthanexpected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23 yearoveryear, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31 constant currency growth, up from 28 in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came inline with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the bestpositioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes. Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Alok Sama: People often ask me you're cynical about Silicon Valley, you're cynical about Wall Street, but you seem to put Masa Son on a pedestal and that's the reason. He had this quality that completely eludes me, and when he tells me that you're not enough of a hunter, I get where he's coming from. I don't see what he does. I don't see risk the way he sees it. Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Alok Sama, former President and CFO at SoftBank International, and author of the new book, The Money Trap. Lost Illusions inside the Tech Bubble. SoftBank is a Japanese holding company that's made big bets on some of the biggest names in Tech. Alibaba, ByteDance, Arm Holdings, also Uber, DoorDash, Lemonade, Opendoor, and a lot more. Some of those bets have paid off handsomely. Others quite the opposite. From 20142019, Sama was a top executive at SoftBank, where he worked closely with the firm's founder, Masayoshi Son and had a front row seat as the company launched its legendary 100 billion vision fund. My colleague, Ricky Mulvey recently caught up with Sama for a conversation about the delicious circularity in AI markets. The difference between being a hunter and being a cook, what it means to live in the future, and knowing when to sell. Quick programming note before we get to today's show. Since this conversation runs a bit longer than usual, we won't be posting an episode tomorrow. Enjoy the day off Fools. We'll see you again on Monday. Ricky Mulvey: We'll get into the book, but I want to start with this OpenAI news, because you're comfortable talking about your former employer. You just wrote a book about them, and they're back in the news with this investment in OpenAI. The nonprofit just raised 6.6 billion at a 157 billion valuation. SoftBank putting 500 million into the mix. What do you make of this valuation, this rise of OpenAI right now? Alok Sama: Candidly, I think SoftBank investing 500 million is probably the least interesting aspect of the deal. You got to keep in mind as mind boggling as these numbers seem. SoftBank has when I last l close to 40 billion in cash, son signed his last AGM, talked about everything else he's done previously is a warm up bag. You can put that together in the context of a man who's been known for big, bold, audacious usually spectacularly successful moves. This is not his big moves, I guess. Let's talk about OpenAI. To me, the question I get asked a lot is AI, is it overhyped? Are some of these valuations over hyped? When I see Safe Superintelligence, which is another company that raised prerevenue. Forget about business model, just the concept from our OpenAI employee raising 1 billion. Is it a 5 billion valuation? OpenAI at 157 billion for a company that is bleeding cash, 5 billion from reports and beating people too. They lost their CTO and a whole bunch of people. You have to ask the question. A things getting overdone? Is there element of formal going on? I suspect in the private space there is because, unlike Google, for example, in its early days. with with OpenAI there's real competition out there. There's Google for one, and getting AI right is existential for Google. Talk about deep pockets, Google's got their own Gemini, LLM. You've got Facebook, again, with that monumental user base across its various platforms into Facebook Whatsapp, and they've got an opensource AI LLM out there. this competition, there's real alternatives. Having said that, there's no doubt, OpenAI is very real, first mover. Chat GPT has become almost synonymous with AI in the eyes of the world. There are strong traction in the enterprise user base. I I don't argue with the fact that it's worth a ton. I just wonder about a 150 billion number as I do about 5 billion for Safe Superintelligence for a company, that's just belly on a concept. That to me and it's a good thing this stuff is going on in the private markets because I've lived through inflated valuations 2000. You had these sorts of things going on in the public market at that point in time. There are other aspects of OpenAI. Sorry, I'm branding on a little bit, I just find this so interesting that. The other thing that's really interesting about OpenAI, is you've got five capital leading this round. They led the previous round, so they get to mark up the deal in the books at 2X. That's unusual in VC Lane. People don't very often do that. You've also got investors to the investors who are participating are Microsoft and NVIDIA. Guess what? OpenAI does with the money they raise. They take the cash, and they buy capacity on Microsoft Cloud. The money goes to Microsoft. What does Microsoft do with the money? Well, it buys NVIDIA chips. The money goes to NVIDIA. There's almost a delicious sort of circularity. It's a little bit incestuous too. There's a lot going on in that deal and as great a company as it is, and Sam Ortman, terrific entrepreneur and obviously, a fundraiser and a salesman, too. I think there's a real risk when you start extrapolating that valuation as people often do in terms of other things going on in the private and the public space. Ricky Mulvey: What do you think that valuation is based on then? That 157 billion? Alok Sama: I think that's my point. I don't know. Having said that, I've been in tech Investment land, and frequently, in my book, I tell the story of how Son, Sam and I have dinner with Mark Zuckerberg, and the one thing that came through to me loud and clear, is Masa's regret, even pay a not investing in Facebook at a 10 billion valuation and I dare say when Facebook was served up at 10 billion, you and I might have had the same discussion or not come up with an answer, which is what is that 10 billion based on? Look that's frequently the case with technology. Relatively early stage technology investments. It's just very difficult to hang your hat on a specific valuation number. There is a huge leap of faith involved, and you take the view that look, there's an asymmetric payoff. this thing from 150, it could be worth over 2 trillion the way NVIDIA is or Facebook is, right? That's the only sensible response I can give you. There is no conventional valuation metric that would, as I sit here today, give me enough time to make something up, but I can't come up with something on the spot of the moment. Ricky Mulvey: In your book, you talked about these early stage companies, where they don't have cash flow and that's often that is what you value companies on, so you have to move to something like, what would it be gross merchandise value or the total amount of sales going on in an online marketplace and not necessarily the cut or the profit even that a company is being taken from that. We're seeing a lot for the retail investors listening. What what are the company metrics that sort of set off your BS meter for these young emerging exciting companies? Alok Sama: I think too much of an emphasis on revenue multiples, for example, you talked about GMV. There was a real heart button. GMV is gross merchandise value and, in the context of an e commerce company. you buy something on Amazon for 100 bucks. That's the gross merchant value. Amazon's cut of that might be, five or 10. That's Amazon's revenue. You could have a huge GMV and not make any money at all. the 10 is revenue, and then there's cost. When I see people extrapolating of revenue multiples into infinity, and the profit is a complete leap of faith, I start scratching my head. That to me is is a bit of a red flag. I don't call it a BS. I think that's way too strong. I think OpenAI is very real. It's going to be worth a lot. I just don't know how much, and I don't know how to value it. Ricky Mulvey: You've been a part of multiple bull cycles, and your book covers being a part of those, and people go with the herd. They react as if I'm not going to quote directly, but people react as if they're on drugs when they're part of these mad herds running toward these evaluations, and for us listening, you'd expect you'd expect the bankers to react as you right? Like, Mr. Spock evaluating these investing decisions with very cold, hard analytical skills. That doesn't seem to be the case. It seems that emotions continue to rule no matter where you are in the investing spectrum. Alok Sama: I think that's always going to be the case. I think 300 years. Book I talked about this wonderful example of this book written by the Scotsman Charles Mackay. I think it was written in the 18th century and this guys like isit's considered to be, like the ultimate authority on bubbles. He talked about. People might have heard of tulips in Meerland, and how ridiculous that became right there. But but this guy missed the biggest bubble in his own lifetime, which was railroads in England. Those of you might have watched Dan and abbey. Lord Grantham, that's how he lost his shirt on laughs Railroad. This has been documented for a long time and I got to tell you I've been in and out of these markets for lost at this point, man, I'm showing my age almost 40 years. I get caught up, too. Everyone goes free. But I tell you, the one thing that is it's good, and this is actually really useful to talk about is to the extent there's frat, a lot of that is in the private markets and not the public markets. The big difference relative to the Internet bubble is the hype at the time was in public markets. You had companies prerevenue, going public at ridiculous valuation IPOs that were double 2x3x. I think what's happened now, it's interesting is you had so much access in the public markets, and we forgotten very quickly in 2021. 2021, you had I think the number is 1,100 IPOs, off which, 600 were SPACs. Remember those? Many of those just blew up. Some of those were like we work, which went to zero, others, 23 and me, for example. All these sacks went public at 10 bucks, but 23 and M is trading at pennies. Again, look at previous cycles, 2000, for example. It takes the IPO market at a minimum of four years to recover, and you haven't had excess in the public markets. Yes, NVIDIA has been a rocket ship, but if you look at NVIDIA, it creates that depending on what your projection is between 3540 times earnings. That's not for a company with 75 profit margins and growing the way it has. That's not outrageous. Outrageous was Cisco at 200 times earnings in year 2000. by the way, if you'd invested in Cisco in the year 2000, you'd still be losing. It's the private markets that's why there's a lot of raised eyebrows. Ricky Mulvey: Think why is there so much laggy you think in the private markets compared to the public markets right now, especially with Froth? You mentioned the spack lesson, where I got burned a little bit on a couple of SPACs that I got excited about that still haven't recovered. But within the private markets especially, it seems to be ruled by almost the lesson that you mentioned earlier with Masa Son not investing in Facebook at 10 million. A lot of these private market investors, VCs, almost don't lament the things they spent money on and then lost. They lament the opportunities that passed them by that ended up 100 X, 1,000 Xing, that thing. Alok Sama: Look, these are some of the smartest, savviest people around, and that put Masa Keno Hill in terms of his ability to spot macro trends, and there's no doubt that what's going on with AI certainly at the enterprise level, where it's proving out very quickly, truly is transformational as a productivity true. I think the jury is out in terms of at the individual level, how it might impact our lives. I haven't seen any apps, the way we did with Web 2.0. Uber, etc. Maybe those will come, but the jury is still out. But at the enterprise level, it is transformational as a productivity true, and people get that, and there's just not a lot of plays around. As a VC, it's not a trend you can sit on out. It out. You're seeing that. There are others, for example, I'm associated with Warburg Pincuse, which is not a household name, but one for people in the business would recognize it as absolutely cutting edge when it comes to growth investing, particularly in technology. They've chosen to set out these big flashy evaluations, and I focus instead on AI, the enterprise level and buying it to businesses where you could make a huge impact on margins, can top line, as well as bottom line, leveraging AI. it is I'm being up if I'm answering your question, but from a VC growth investive perspective, it's like, you can't afford to sit this out. Ricky Mulvey: It's something where with your analytical brain, you can't value. If we're moving toward the singularity. Ricky Mulvey: How do you even put a price tag on that thing? Let's get in. Alok Sama: I do put a price tag on dreams a little bit. I may I use that expression in my book. It's tough. The excitement is very real. I'm excited about it. I just can't figure out or value it. Ricky Mulvey: Let's get into your journey at SoftBank. The investing style really revolves around the happiness for everyone pitch, this dream of Masa Son. While I know you've heard it a bunch of times, many of our listeners haven't. What is happiness for everyone? Alok Sama: What he's trying to get at is idealism when it comes to technology investing. Let's go back. General Electric used to be a technology company once upon a time. It's Thomas Edison's Company. You could make a legitimate case that electricity, light bubs, for example, contributed to helps for everyone. I think that's a lot of what Son Sann's talking about, which is leveraging technology to improve lives. Happiness, he can get overly philosophical about that, but that's what he's trying to get at. The first time I met him, I remember right in the lobby of his building, and then he talked about it when I met with him. He had this empathetic robot, Pepper, which was supposed to be a companion for the agent. This is again, AI powered with an emotional engine, supposed to be a companion in Japan, with an aging population. It's a real issue with the highest suicide rates in the world. That's addressing, that's laudable. That's a lot of where Masa is coming from. Very different from history of AI is a benign. It's going to make lives better view, different from Elon who thinks that this might be something we have to run away from and colonize mass. Ricky Mulvey: There's also I was talking to Nate Silver on the show a few weeks ago. It's the AI makes the world a worse version of a casino. You mentioned to the robot, and many of the predictions of Masa son came true. With the Pepper robot, you now have AI chat bots that are exactly like the movie Her, where people are having quote, real relationships with them in order to combat loneliness. That's a whole rabbit hole, we have very complicated feelings. But for the base of this, it's something that it came true. When you were going through these deals, was that something where, you would present a evaluation case, but you would also have to present this is how it makes the world happier with the companies we're interested in investing in or did that come upstream before it got to you? Alok Sama: Short answer is no. We didn't have, I never thought about it, but, something like a happiness index or anything associated with an investment memo. But the thing about Masa, and this is what really got me hooked. This is a man who describes himself as a crazy guy who lives in the future. A lot of people think of investing as bits. Almost gambling. Son is not a man, you'll find within a million mile radius of Vegas. She's not a gambling man. I associate gambling with addictive thrill seeking behavior. That's not him. A man who lives in the future and when you live in the future, you say tomorrow's headlines, your assessment of risk is fundamentally different. It was often felt when I had doubts, reservations, who am I to hold him back? He backed Alibaba. Based on his vision for what ecommerce might unfold in China, based on looking at how it had evolved in the US. But I tell you, what's even cooler? This is literally my favorite Masa Son story, and I think one that people will relate to. I think we can all agree. We all felt that excitement when we held a smartphone and iPhone for the first time, I certainly did in my hands, which is, man, this is seriously cool. This is life changing. Now, but Masa Son, before the iPhone existed, as is talking about 2005, draws up a picture of something that looks like an iPhone and takes it to Steve Jobs and said, Steve, you're the only one who can come up with something like this and when you do, you got to give me an exclusive for Japan. Steve tells him, you're a crazy guy. I like you. I don't have a product. You don't have a phone company. What am I going to give you an exclusive for, but I like you. If I do something like this, I'll give you an exclusive. On the back of this somewhat casual conversation, handshake, no contractual obligation. He goes and spends 20 billion buying or close to 20 billion buying this company in Japan, which is just bleeding cash. It is such a dog that Vodafone, which owned the company actually lends Masa money to take it off its hands. Steve Jobs comes up with the iPhone in early 2007, and gives Masa the exclusive, because he always saw this smartphones, he builds this company around marketing data oriented network, selling smartphones to the Japanese, and ends up on a mark to market basis when the company went public, making 40 billion. It's a monumental number. Hundred billion mark to market on Arm, 75 billion on Alibaba, 40 billion on SoftBank, Japan, the mobile company. These are spectacular successes. Ricky Mulvey: When you meet him through your friend, it was Nikesh. Where you met Masa Son and you said, I made Masa feel I understood his brand of genius. I'll quote.\" As a banker you have to make a lot of really wealthy people feel smart and understood\". This is that game at the highest level. How do you do that? Alok Sama: I talk a little bit about that. I think my experience with CEOs is they like to talk about their business, their vision, and they don't like being sold to. When you start reading from a pitch book, and you get into salesy mode, you denigrate yourself a little bit. My approach was always to look them in the eye, and as if I'm having a cup of coffee with them, having a drink with them, and let them talk and hopefully try and respond intelligently to what they say. You get up rapper going, and they come away saying that, OK, this is a guy I can relate to. He gets me, and when they have an idea or a problem they want to solve, hopefully they call you. Ricky Mulvey: With Masa, you don't need to convince him that, you're also a crazy guy. Like he's not looking for that? He's not looking for a little bit of crazy. Alok Sama: Well, look. One of the pivotal chapters in the book is I talked about this idea of hunters and cooks. Son Sann tells me that, you need to be more of a hunter. You're basically suggesting I was a cook. Sorry, Wait. Ricky Mulvey: You're Michelin Cook. Alok Sama: Well, that was a Michelin star chef man. That's what I was fishing for, because I was good at what I did, which is getting deals done. No, but honestly, my role there, and I think that's true for a lot of people around Son Sann is they tend to be facilitators facilitating his vision because the quality he has, living in the future, vision, as a futurist as a technologist, is just not something you can replicate. I did not have that. That is part of why people often ask me, you're cynical about Silicon Valley, you're cynical about Wall Street, which you seem to put Masa Son on a pedestal. That's the reason. He had this quality that completely eludes me. When he tells me that you're not enough of a hunter. I get where he's coming from. I don't see what he does. I don't see risk the way he sees it. Ricky Mulvey: One of the central themes of your book is the idea of power, and how there are people who you have an immense amount of power you're flying on private jets. You're moving in billions of dollars. Then there's also times within your interactions with Masa Son, where you appear almost, like, more powerless. I would say one of those is within the WeWork deal where Softbank goes on to invest tens of billions of dollars in WeWork. You seem to be in the spot where you're like, this person is a silver tongued Adam Neumann, like a silvertongued snake oil salesperson. Feel free to disagree with my assessment. I see a shake of the head. Alok Sama: Wow, two things. I talk about power, but not to be overly philosophical about this, but I talk about power being an illusion. In the epilogue, book starts with a dramatic scene where I'm at Claridges Hotel in Mayfair in London with two most agents, if you can believe. They tell me I have power because I control billiger dollars, and my feedback to them is power. That's an illusion. I can barely control my own bladder. It gets philosophical when I lose both my parents, my dog within a very short period of time. It just brings home that the notion that you control anything in your life is a bit of an illusion. That's a bit of a philosophical as opposed to an investment point. In the context of WeWork, look, it's Adam Neumann it's a cool fun story. He's been a movie made about it. It's a fun movie. I enjoyed it. Jared Leto does a great job. Son, he acknowledged it himself. I think his exact words were. He said that I blame myself even more than Adam Neumann. That's the nature of the VC game. You're not gonna get everything. You just got to keep in mind that he might have lost 10 billion on WeWork, which is monumental by any standards, but he also made 100 billion on Arm. I take that trade any day. Ricky Mulvey: Well, I'm going to stand on the philosophical point for a sec, because I think it's interesting where you put that. There's multiple definitions of power, and we almost need different words for it. There's the idea that you cannot control almost the acts of uncontrollable natural forces, sickness, that thing. We have that word for power, but then we also have the ability to make people do things. That is also combined by power and when billions of dollars is being put into WeWork, when billions of dollars is being put into chip companies, there's a business model that you're also a part of that has led to things like people getting free Uber rides. That I've been on the downstream of SoftBanks actions in the market. That is an intense form of power, man. That's also very real. It's different from the other thing you're describing. Alok Sama: Look, that's fair. I think the impact that SoftBank had on the investment landscape in the Valley is profound. I talk the book about how Sequoia, which is King of the Hill in the Valley. That's Google, you name it. Every major technology success story they've been behind. I'm a bit of a golf nut and I described the meeting with Doug Leone, who's the managing partner, Sequoia. His reaction using a golfing metaphor. I go back to Bobby Jones, arguably the greatest of all times when he sees Jack Nicklaus play and his reaction is, he plays a game with which I'm not familiar. What Masa did with the vision Fund did was a game changer and just to be very specific, Sequoia, billion dollar funds were rare in the value. Sequoia was probably the biggest one. I think that fund was two billion. The next fund turned out to be eight billion. Everyone felt they needed a bigger boat. That when that 100 billion fund came along. I think the total volume of VC investing in the previous year was 70 billion. This was monumental. We talked about OpenAI toward the beginning of that discussion. It's these large megacap technology funds, venture slash growth funds, with a ton of liquidity and that's a little bit of what you're saying. They need to deploy a lot of money in the new thing. You still saying that. A little bit of that is the SoftBank effect. A little bit of that is also this weird notion we had of modern monetary theory and printing money. It's a combination of factors. Ricky Mulvey: Sequoia, the relationship with them wasn't always rosy. They were upset at SoftBank because of essentially the valuations and the money that the investment fund was putting in to smaller companies to which they were also invested, which on the surface, you would think, great, more money going into an investment I own, the valuations getting larger. I'm making a lot of money off of this, but that wasn't the case always with Sequoia. Alok Sama: No. I think their objection to be fair was, again, it comes back to the notion of power and control. The conventional VC approach is you sit on the board and you drift feed capital. Like you're talking about tens of millions at the time, I gave you a certain benchmarks, I evaluate you against that, you hit your goals, I'll give you no money, so on so forth. I very tightly controlled allocation capital. Nothing wrong with that. It serve people like Sequoia brilliantly. Masa's view is, I used the expression. He treated founders, the way they want to be treated by an investor, which is I love you, man. It is I give the example of Radesh, which is what came up in the context of Sequoia. Radesh got married, Masa flew from Japan to India to attend the guys' marriage. It's that personal level of engagement that belief in an entrepreneur. I believe in you, I back you, whatever capital you need. I'm behind you. I think that's a little bit of what the VCs were struggling with. That's one of the things that's very different about how Masa approach to investing. Ricky Mulvey: One of the things you write about, let's talk about selling. This is something a lot of our listeners think about, especially, we're heavy into a mega trend. We're back into a bull market. You right, \"While Masa had an impressive track record investing ahead of technology mega trends, he frequently held on to long.\" We'll start with what led you to that conclusion, and then I'll ask you what you learned from it. Why do you think Masa held on too long? Because frequently we hear the reverse that investors are too tradery, and they sell too much, and that hurts them. Alok Sama: I think let's look at that comment was made at probably halfway through the book and just based on the observation, that South Banks Yahoo stake, Yahoo was king of the hell. Some of us who we are old enough to remember, like late '90s, 2000, it was the portal to the web. His stake in Yahoo at its peak was 30 billion. He ended up selling it at seven billion. I think the same thing turned out to be true with Alibaba. I think on a mark to market basis at one point, Masa that stake would have been worth, I want to say 200 billion or something very close to that. At its peak, he ended up liquidating it at 75 billion. Now, it is still a spectacular success story, or those are still spectacular success stories. But obviously, had he sold off at a different time, he would have made a lot more, which would suggest that, he's not a great trader, but man that's a completely different skill set. That's what prompted that remark. Ricky Mulvey: The other side of this though is Nvidia. When SoftBank didn't have an investment, and, it's better to have loved than who have never loved at all. But what led to the sale in Nvidia? Because this is what happened to the fact. Alok Sama: That's a great question. I think we can learn something from that. First of all, two things about Nvidia. Early 2017, Masa wanted to buy the company Nvidia. With a controlled premium, we could have bought the company for 80 billion. Could have been a history, it's worth over two trillion now. We all know that. CFIs, which is the Committee for Foreign Investment to the United States, there is no way, the US government would have CFIs. Acting through CFIs would have allowed a deal like that, foreign ownership of something as strategic to AIs and Nvidia, so that was off the table. What Masa ended up doing is buying in the fund. When you buy on your own balance sheet, if you've actually bought a company, the way he did on, with the intention of holding on, making some operational changes, as opposed to buying on a leverage basis in a fund with this pressure to recycle fund to investors, your mindset changes a little bit, and that's what happened with Nvidia in the fund, which is, he on a leverage basis, made a brilliant return. But if he'd held on, that that 4x, 5x could have been 20x. Ricky Mulvey: Some of that, did that have to do with the funds deal where it was paying out, what was it like a 7 dividend to all of its holders through out which is uncommon for a tech when we think of high tech investments, you're going for those big home runs. You're not going for these steady dividend payments. Alok Sama: The division fund was completely unique, in as much as there was a layer of leverage provided by the limited partners. That was part of the fund. The investors, the limited partners, mainly the Middle Eastern investors out of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, they also provided capital in the form of mezzanine, which paid a cash dividend 7. The fund had to pay them cash, and that created pressure to realize liquidity and that again, is at least a small part of the explanation, that when you have an opportunity to liquidate something, you try and do it. Ricky Mulvey: You told the story earlier of the dinner you had where you were described as a cook and not a hunter. Your job changed dramatically at SoftBank, around 2019. You went from president and CFO to senior advisor. When did you feel your job really changing? That we talked about power as a nebulous thing. When did you feel your power softening and feeling almost sideline moved out of one of the top seats there? Alok Sama: I think that happened earlier. When I left and became a senior advisor, I was basically out. That's the way I wanted it, and that's the way we negotiated. Someone wanted me out of the vision fund. When I was shut out of the vision fund, even though there was some very interesting stuff that was going on outside of the vision fund, for example, SoftBank owned Sprint and I let the merger of Sprint with T mobile. There was a lot to do outside of the vision fund, but I was excluded from the vision fund, and at the time, SoftBank focus was very much on the vision fund. That was an element, I think it's fair to say of being if not sideline, certainly being one step removed from where the real action was. That's where it started to happen in terms of the drift. Ricky Mulvey: Did a two part question, then I went down a digression, I'm going to get back to the two part question now that I remember it. What did you learn about when to sell from your experience at SoftBank? How does that affect you as an investor now? Alok Sama: My personal philosophy is, that whole line about, bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. My personal view of the world is, man, if I run into a situation where I've doubled my money or tripled my money or whatever, I'm out of there. I tend not to get too greedy. But that's not in the world of technology, that is most certainly not the right answer. Because if you've got a winner in the world of technology, you need to be thinking, not just 10x, but, like, potentially a 100x. Like Masa Son, you look at the Alibaba success story, that's like, 40 million, eventually, 75 billion realized. Now, it would be really unfair to criticize him for not realizing 200 billion because it is arguably the most spectacular investment all time. My mindset is a little bit conservative because, I'm particularly at my stage in life. I'm thinking in terms of my nest egg for retirement. But if you want to be a successful technology investor, you've got to think in terms of really backing your winners. You're seeing that with the funds. Sequoia started this is frequently because of the venture funds. Because of pressure to recycle capital, they were getting out too early, they created a separate fund where you could hang on much much longer. It's like, Google computer next google. You bought Google at IPO, it'd be a spectacular investment. Ricky Mulvey: The money trap lost illusions inside the tech bubble. I want to mention this to listeners. You didn't get a ghost writer for this. It is beautifully, right? Alok Sama: What? No. Quite the contrary, I did not set off to write this book, but I wanted to be a writer, and I spent twoandahalf years in graduate school. I got an MFA at New York University. Just in experimenting, like all students do, was like, I was writing and throwing stuff up on the wall and see what's Dick's thing. That's how this book came about. It's been a real labor of love for me. Ricky Mulvey: It's a lyrical, it's beautifully written. I really enjoyed the stories in it. I learned some stuff for my investing brain. I think our listeners will get a lot out of it. There's a lot of big business people when they write a memoir, sometimes it's a history written things that's given off to a ghost writer. Your book is the complete opposite of that. It's thoughtful, it's warm, it's personal. I really enjoyed it, and I'm grateful for the time and insight. Alok Sama: Thanks, Wicky.

        "prompt": "Title: Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season\nPublished: Wed, 16 Oct 2024 19:45:25 +0000\nArticle: Were rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if theres one company that everyone is watching, its Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of the chip giant are up more than 16 in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the companys upcoming Blackwell chip is insane during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18, topping out at 130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday. Nvidias incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule. In the companys fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206 to 18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279 to 14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isnt staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors. Dont believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154 year over year to 26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6 immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the companys stock price to recover. The AI trade hasnt raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59 year to date, outpacing the broader SP 500 (GSPC), which rose 21. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19 and AMD (AMD) added just 6 to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55. Broadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of ondevice AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability. Then theres Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its thirdparty chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space. But Nvidia is still the handsdown star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling. Theyll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidias announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries. Wall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidias Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips.

        "prompt": "Title: Jim Cramer on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)s Copilot: I Have No Idea If Theres A Real Weakness Here But There Is Chatter And Thats Enough To Send The Stock Down\nPublished: Wed, 16 Oct 2024 19:32:09 +0000\nArticle: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list. On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\" Cramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zerosum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market. Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this ones definitely not a zerosum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because theres just a lot of money going around. He noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable. We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again. Cramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial fourweek earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added: Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon. Cramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkeys database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275 since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Cramer mentioned that he does not see a prominent weakness with Microsoft Corporations (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot but cited chatter around it. Microsoft's supposed to be hurt by weakening demand for its Copilot, with its Copilot being their AI assistant. I have no idea if there's a real weakness here but there is chatter and that's enough to send the stock down. That said, I think the bears need a lot more than chatter to keep it down. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has evolved beyond its origins in software, operating systems, and web browsers to become a significant player in various emerging industries. Today, it ranks as one of the largest providers of cloud infrastructure globally, which positions the company favorably to market AI products and services to its cloud clients. In its last quarter, the company reported revenue of 64.7 billion, a 15 increase compared to the previous year. It highlighted impressive growth in its Azure Cloud services. In the quarter, Azure revenue surged by 30. Looking forward, management expects that the results from Azure will further accelerate in the latter half of fiscal 2025, driven by substantial investments in new data center capacity that are set to come online. Its growth is not solely limited to cloud services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also experiencing significant adoption of its Copilot software, an AIpowered assistant designed to improve workplace productivity. In the fourth quarter, the number of Microsoft 365 Copilot customers increased by over 60 sequentially. With a user base exceeding 400 million for Office 365, the company remains wellpositioned for continued growth in this domain. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
